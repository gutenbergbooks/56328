<h2><a name="MUSCULAR_SYSTEM_OF_ORGANIC" id="MUSCULAR_SYSTEM_OF_ORGANIC">MUSCULAR SYSTEM OF ORGANIC
LIFE.</a></h2>


<p>This system is not as abundantly spread out in the
economy as the preceding. The whole mass which it
forms, compared with the whole of the other, which is
more than one third of the body, presents in this respect
a very remarkable difference. Its position is also different;
it is concentrated, 1st, in the thorax, where the
heart and Å“sophagus belong to it; 2d, in the abdomen
where the stomach and intestines are in part formed by
it; 3d, in the pelvis where it contributes to form the
bladder and even the womb, though this belongs to generation,
which is a function distinct from organic life.
This system then occupies the middle of the trunk, is
foreign to the extremities, and is found far from the
action of external bodies, whilst the other superficially
situated, forming almost alone the extremities, seems, as
we have said, almost as much destined in the trunk to
protect the other organs, as to execute the different motions
of the animal. The head contains no part of the
organic muscular system; this region of the body is
wholly devoted to the organs of animal life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span></p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>ARTICLE FIRST.<br />

<small>OF THE FORMS OF THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM OF ORGANIC
LIFE.</small></h3>

<p>All the muscles of the preceding system take in general
a straight direction. These are all on the contrary
curved upon themselves; all represent muscular cavities
differently turned, sometimes cylindrical as in the intestines,
sometimes conical as in the heart, sometimes rounded
as in the bladder, and sometimes very irregular as in the
stomach. No one is attached to the bones; all are destitute
of tendinous fibres. The white fibres arising from
the internal surface of the heart, and going to be attached
to the valves of its ventricles, have by no means the
nature of the tendons. Ebullition does not easily reduce
them to gelatine; desiccation does not give them the
yellowish appearance of these organs; they resist maceration
longer than them.</p>

<p>It is in general a great character that distinguishes the
muscular organic system from that of animal life, that it
does not arise from, nor terminate in fibrous organs. All
the fibres of this last are continuous either with tendons,
or aponeuroses or fibrous membranes. Almost all those
of the first go on the contrary from the cellular texture,
and return to it after having run their course. I at first
thought that the dense and compact texture which is between
the mucous membrane and the fleshy fibres of the
intestines, the bladder, the stomach, &amp;c. was an assemblage
and net-work of many small tendons corresponding
to these fibres, and interwoven in the form of an aponeurosis;
the density of this layer deceived me at first view.
Ebullition, maceration, and desiccation have since taught
me, that this layer, completely foreign to the fibrous system,
should be referred, as Haller has said, to the cellular,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
which is only more dense and compact there than elsewhere.
It is this layer, which I have designated, in the
cellular system by the name of the sub-mucous texture.
Many fibres of the system of which we are treating appear
to form an entire curve, which is not crossed by
any cellular intersection; some layers of the heart exhibit
this arrangement, which is in general very rare; so
that there is almost always an origin and termination of
the fibres, upon an organ of a nature different from their
own.</p>

<p>We can hardly consider in a general manner the forms
of the system of which we are treating; each organ belonging
to it is moulded upon the form of the viscus to
the formation of which it contributes. In fact, the organic
muscles do not exist in distinct fasciculi, like those
of animal life; all, except the heart, form but a third, a
quarter and often even less in the structure of a viscus.</p>

<p>The greatest number has a thin, flat and membranous
form. There are layers more or less broad, and hardly
ever distinct fasciculi. Placed at the side of each other,
the fibres are rarely one above another; hence it happens
that occupying a very great extent, these muscles form
however a very small volume. The great gluteus alone
would be larger than all the fibres of the stomach, the intestines
and the bladder, if they were united like it into
a thick and square muscle.</p>


<hr class="chap" />

<h3>ARTICLE SECOND.<br />

<small>ORGANIZATION OF THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM OF ORGANIC
LIFE.</small></h3>

<p>The organization of the involuntary muscles is not as
uniform as that of the preceding. In these all is exactly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
similar excepting the differences of the proportion of the
fleshy fibres to the tendinous, of the length of the first,
of the prominence of the fasciculi, of their assemblage
into flat, long or short muscles; in whatever place we examine
them, their varieties are in their forms and not in
their texture. Here on the contrary, there is in this texture
marked differences; the heart compared with the
stomach, the intestines with the bladder are sufficient to
convince us of this. It is by virtue of these different
textures, that the contractility and sensibility vary as we
shall see in each muscle, that the force of the contraction
is not the same, and that life is different in each, whilst it
is uniform in all those of animal life. We shall now
consider in a general manner the organization of the involuntary
muscles.</p>


<h4>I. <i>Texture peculiar to the Organization of the Muscular
System of Organic Life.</i></h4>

<p>The organic muscular fibre is in general much finer and
more delicate than that of the preceding system; it is
not brought into as thick fasciculi. Very red in the
heart, it is whitish in the gastric and urinary organs.
Besides, this colour varies remarkably. I have observed
that sometimes maceration renders it of a deep brown in
the intestines.</p>

<p>This fibre never has one single direction, like that of
the preceding muscles; it is interlaced always, or found
in juxta-position in different directions; sometimes it is at
a right angle that the fasciculi are cut, as in the longitudinal
and circular fibres of the gastric tubes; sometimes
it is with angles more or less obtuse or acute, as in the
stomach, the bladder, &amp;c. In the heart, this interlacing is
such in the ventricles, that it is a true muscular net-work.
From these varieties of direction, results an advantage in
the motions of these sorts of muscles, which, being all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
hollow can by contracting diminish according to many
diameters the extent of their cavity.</p>

<p>Every organic muscular fibre is in general short; those
which, like the longitudinal of the Å“sophagus, the rectum,
&amp;c. appear to run a long course, are not continuous; they
arise and terminate at short distances, and thus arise and
terminate successively in the same direction or line; no
one is comparable to those of the sartorius, the gracilis,
&amp;c. as it respects length.</p>

<p>We know the nature of their fibres no better than that
of those of animal life; but they appear nearly the same
under the action of the different reagents. Desiccation,
putrefaction, maceration, ebullition, exhibit in them the
same phenomena. I have observed upon the subject of
this last, that once boiled, the fibres of both systems are
much less alterable by the acids sufficiently weakened.
After being some time in the sulphuric, the muriatic and
nitric diluted with water, they soften a little, but keep
their original form, and do not change into that pulp to
which raw fibres are always reduced in the same experiment.
The last of these acids turns them yellow as before
ebullition.</p>

<p>I have also made an observation as it respects the horny
hardening which is produced the instant ebullition commences;
it is this, that it is always the same whatever
may have been the antecedent dilatation or contraction of
the fibres. The stomach which at death was so dilated as
to contain many pints of fluid, is reduced to the same
size, all other things being equal, as that which is contracted
so as to be no larger than the cÅ“cum. Diseases
have a little influence on the horny hardening. The heart
of a phthisical patient exhibited to me in the same experiment
this phenomenon much less evidently, than that
of an apoplectic.</p>

<p>The resistance of the organic muscular fibre is in proportion
much greater than that of the fibres of the animal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
muscular system. Whatever may be the distension of the
hollow muscles by the fluid which fills them during life,
ruptures hardly ever take place in them.</p>

<p>The bladder alone sometimes exhibits this phenomenon,
which is however very rare in it. In the great
retentions of the urine, in which ruptures take place, it is
almost always the urethra that is ruptured, and the bladder
remains whole. We meet in practice with a hundred
fistulas in the perineum, coming from the membranous
portion, to one above the pubis. We find in authors many
examples of rupture of the diaphragm; we know of but few
of the rupture of the stomach, the intestines and the heart.</p>


<h4>II. <i>Common Parts in the Organization of the Muscular
System of Organic Life.</i></h4>

<p>The cellular texture is in general much more rare in
the organic muscles than in the others. The fibres of the
heart are in juxta-position, rather than united by this texture.
It is a little more evident in the gastric and urinary
muscles. It is almost wanting in the womb; thus these
muscles are not infiltrated, like the preceding, in dropsies;
they never exhibit that fatty state of which we have
spoken, and which sometimes loads the fibres. I have not
observed in these fibres the yellowish tinge which the
others often take, especially in the vertebral depressions.</p>

<p>The blood vessels are very numerous in this system;
they are found in it even in greater proportion than in the
other; more blood consequently penetrates them. This
fact is remarkable, especially in the intestines, in which
the mesenteric arteries distribute numerous branches, over
an extremely delicate fleshy surface. But I would remark
that this appearance is to a certain degree deceptive, as
many of these vessels only traverse the fleshy surface to
go to the mucous membrane. In the ordinary state they
give to the gastric viscera a reddish tinge, which I have
rendered at will livid and afterwards brought back to its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
primitive state, by shutting and afterwards opening the
stop-cock adapted to the wind pipe, in my experiments
upon asphyxia.</p>

<p>The absorbents and exhalants have nothing peculiar in
this system.</p>

<p>The nerves come to them from two sources; 1st, from
the cerebral system; 2d, from that of the ganglions.</p>

<p>Except in the stomach in which the par vagum is distributed,
the nerves of the ganglions predominate everywhere.
In the heart, they are the principal; in the intestines,
they are the only ones; at the extremity of the
rectum and the bladder, their proportion is greater than
that of the nerves coming from the spine.</p>

<p>The cerebral nerves intermix with them, in penetrating
the organic muscles. The cardiac, solar, hypogastric,
plexuses, &amp;c. result from this intermixture which appears
to have an influence upon the motions, though we are
ignorant of the nature of this influence.</p>

<p>All the nerves of the ganglions which go to the organic
muscles, do not appear to be exclusively destined to them.
A great number of filaments belong only to the arteries;
such is in fact their interlacing, that they form, as we
have seen, around these vessels a real nervous membrane,
superadded to their own, and exclusively destined to
them. I would compare this nervous envelope to the
cellular envelope which is also found around the arteries,
and which is wholly distinct from the surrounding cellular
texture; thus it only has communications with the
nerves of the organic muscles, without being distributed
to these muscles. Besides as the nerves of the ganglions
are always the most numerous and essential in them, and
as their tenuity is extreme, the nervous mass destined to
each is infinitely inferior to that which is found in the
voluntary muscles. The heart and the deltoid muscle
compared together, exhibit in this respect a remarkable
difference.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span></p>


<hr class="chap" />

<h3>ARTICLE THIRD.<br />

<small>PROPERTIES OF THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM OF ORGANIC LIFE.</small></h3>

<p>Under the relation of properties, this system is in part
analogous to the preceding, and in part very different
from it.</p>


<h4>I. <i>Properties of Texture. Extensibility.</i></h4>

<p>Extensibility is very evident in the organic muscles.
The dilatation of the intestines and the stomach by aliments,
by the extrication of gas, by the fluids that are
found there, that of the bladder by the urine, by injections
that are forced in, &amp;c. are essentially owing to this
extensibility.</p>

<p>This property is characterized here by two remarkable
attributes; 1st, by the rapidity with which it can be put
into action; 2d, by the very great extent of which it is
susceptible.</p>

<p>The stomach and intestines pass in an instant from complete
vacuity to great extension. Artificially distended,
the bladder becomes immediately of a size treble, quadruple
even of that which is natural to it. It sometimes
however resists, but this does not prove its defect of extensibility;
it is because the fluid injected irritates it and
makes it contract; the organic contractility in exercise,
then prevents the development of extensibility, as it sometimes
cannot be brought into action by stimulants in a
muscle laid bare, because the animal contractility in exercise
in the muscle, forms an obstacle to it. The muscles
of animal life are never capable of this rapidity in their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
extensibility, whether because they are intersected by
numerous aponeuroses which dilate but slowly, or whether
because their layers of fibres are very thick, two circumstances
that do not exist in the muscles of organic life.
Hence a remarkable phenomenon that I have observed in
all cases of tympanites. When we open the abdomen of
subjects that have died in this state, without wounding
the swelled intestines, these immediately burst out, swell
more, and occupy twice as large a space as they were
contained in in the abdomen; why? Because the parietes
of the abdomen being unable to yield in proportion to the
quantity of gas that is developed, this has been compressed
in the intestines during life, and expands immediately
by its elasticity when the cause of compression
ceases. In dropsies in which the distension is slow, the
abdominal parietes enlarge much more than in tympanites.
The size of the abdomen would be double in this, if the
extensibility of the parietes was in proportion to that of
the intestines.</p>

<p>As to the extent of the extensibility of the organic muscles,
we can form an idea of it by comparing the empty
stomach which oftentimes is not larger than the cÃ¦cum
in its ordinary state, with the stomach containing sometimes
five, six and even eight pints of fluid; the bladder
contracted and concealed behind the pubis, with the bladder
full of urine from suppression, rising sometimes even
above the umbilicus; the rectum empty, with the rectum
filling a part of the pelvis in old people in whom the
excrements have accumulated in it; the intestines contracted
with the intestines greatly distended.</p>

<p>It is to the extent of extensibility of the organic muscles
and to the limits placed to that of the abdominal
parietes, that must be referred a constant phenomenon
that is observed in the gastric viscera; viz. that in the
natural series of their functions, they are never all distended
at the same time; the intestines are filled when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
the matters contained in the stomach are evacuated; the
bladder is not full of urine in the digestive order, until
the other hollow organs are empty, &amp;c. In general, that
is an unnatural order in which all the organs are distended
at once.</p>

<p>There is for the organic muscles a mode of extensibility
wholly different from that of which I have just spoken;
it is that of the heart in aneurisms, and the womb
in pregnancy. The first, for example, acquires a size
double, treble even sometimes in its left side, and yet it
increases at the same time in thickness. This size is not
owing to distension, but to a preternatural growth. The
aneurismatic heart is to the ordinary heart, what this is to
the heart of the infant; it is nutrition that makes the
difference and not distension; for whenever it is owing
to this it diminishes in thickness as it increases in extent;
there is no addition of substance. Besides the aneurismatic
heart has not often the cause that distends it, for
commonly in this case the mitral valves allow a free
passage to the blood; whilst when they are ossified the
left ventricle often remains in a natural state. Moreover,
the slow progress of the formation of aneurism proves
that it is a preternatural nutrition that has presided over
this increase of the heart. You would in vain then empty
this organ of the blood it contains, it would not contract
and resume its dimensions, as the inflated intestine does
which we puncture to allow the air to escape.</p>

<p>In the womb there are two causes of distension; 1st,
the sinuses greatly developed; 2d, an addition of substance,
a real momentary increase of the fibres of the
organ which remains as thick and even more so than in
the natural state. At the time of accouchement, the
sinuses immediately flatten by the contraction of the
fibres; hence the sudden contraction of the organ. But
as on the one hand nutrition alone can remove by decomposition
the substances added to the fibres to enlarge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
them, and as on the other, this function is exerted slowly,
after the womb has undergone the sudden contraction
owing to the flattening of its sinuses, it returns but gradually
and at the end of some time to its ordinary size.
Extensibility is not then brought into action in the womb
filled by the fÅ“tus, and in the aneurismatic heart; these
organs really become at that time the seat of a more
active nutrition; they grow preternaturally, as they have
grown naturally with the other organs; but these do not
then experience an analogous phenomenon, they become
monstrous in comparison. The womb decreases, because
the motion of decomposition naturally predominates over
that of composition after accouchement, whilst it was the
reverse before this period. The aneurismatic heart remains
always so.</p>

<p>These dilatations of the heart should be carefully distinguished
from those really produced by extensibility,
as in the right auricle and ventricle for example, which
are found full of blood at the moment of death, because
the lungs which are weakened, not allowing it to pass
through them, compel it to flow back to the place from
which it came. There are but few hearts which do not
exhibit in very various degrees, these dilatations, which
we have the power in a living animal of increasing or
diminishing at will, according to the kind of death we
produce. Two hearts are hardly ever of the same size
after death; many varieties are met with, and these depend
more or less on the difficulties which the blood experiences
in the last moments, in passing through the
lungs. Hence why in the diseases of the heart, there is
no standard by which we can compare the morbid size,
especially if we examine the organ as a whole. In fact
the distension of the right side can give it an aneurismatic
appearance, and a size even greater than that of some
aneurisms. If we examine the left side separately, the
error is more easily proved, because this side is subject<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
to less variations. But the principal difference consists
in the thickness. The power of contraction appears to
increase in proportion to this thickness, which arises
from the substance added by nutrition. It is this power
which produces the great beating that is felt under the
ribs, the strength of the pulse, &amp;c.</p>


<h5><i>Contractility.</i></h5>

<p>It is in proportion to extensibility. It is often brought
into action in the ordinary state. It is in virtue of this
property, that the stomach, the bladder, the intestines,
&amp;c. contract, and acquire a size so small compared to
what they have when they are full. In general, there is
no muscle of animal life, which is capable of such extreme
contractions as those of organic life.</p>

<p>It should be remarked, however, that life, without
having contractility immediately dependant upon it, since
the intestines, the stomach, and the bladder contract after
death when their distension is removed, modifies it in a
very evident manner. The causes even which alter or
diminish the vital forces have an influence upon it; hence
the following observation that all those accustomed to
open dead bodies can make. When the subject has died
suddenly, and the stomach is empty, it is much contracted;
when, on the contrary, death has been preceded by
a long disease which has weakened its forces, the stomach,
though empty, remains flaccid, and is found but very
little contracted.</p>

<p>We should consider the substances contained in the
hollow muscles of organic life, as true antagonists of
these muscles; for they have not muscles that act in a
direction opposite to theirs. As long as these antagonists
distend them, they do not obey their contractility of texture;
when they are empty, this is brought into action.
It is not, however, upon this property that the mechanism
of the expulsion of matters from these organs turns, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
aliments from the stomach and intestines, urine from the
bladder, blood from the heart, &amp;c. It is the organic contractility
that presides over this mechanism. It is difficult
to distinguish these properties in exercise. One occasions
a slow and gradual contraction, which is without
the alternation of relaxation; the other, quick and sudden,
consisting in a series of relaxations and contractions,
produces the peristaltic motion, those of systole, diastole,
&amp;c. It is after the organic contractility has procured
the evacuation of the hollow muscles, that the contractility
of texture closes them. In death from hemorrhage
from a great artery, the left and even the right side of
the heart send out all the blood they contain; afterwards
empty, they contract powerfully, and the organ is very
small. On the contrary, it is very large when much
blood remaining in its cavities, distends it, as in asphyxia.
These are the two extremes. There are, as I have said,
many intermediate states.</p>

<p>The contractility of texture is, in the system of which
we are treating, in proportion to the number of fleshy
fibres. Thus, all things being equal, the rectum, when
empty, contracts upon itself with much more force than
the other large intestines; the contraction of the ventricles
is much greater than that of the auricles, and that of
the Å“sophagus is much greater than that of the duodenum,
&amp;c. &amp;c.</p>


<h4>II. <i>Vital Properties.</i></h4>

<p>They are almost in an inverse order of those of the
preceding system.</p>


<h5><i>Properties of Animal Life. Sensibility.</i></h5>

<p>The animal sensibility is slight in the organic muscles.
We know the observation related by Harvey upon a
caries of the sternum that laid bare the heart; they irri<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>tated,
without its being felt by the patient, this organ,
which only contracted under the stimulant. Remove the
peritoneum behind the bladder of a living dog, and irritate
the subjacent muscular layer, the animal gives but
few marks of pain. It is difficult to make these experiments
upon the intestines and the stomach; their muscular
coat is so delicate that we cannot act upon it without
at the same time stimulating the subjacent nerves.</p>

<p>It appears that the organic muscles are much less susceptible
of the feeling of lassitude, of which the preceding
become the seat after great exercise. I do not know
however if in those to which many cerebral nerves go,
it does not take place; for example, when the stomach
has been for a long time contracted, it is probable that the
lassitude of its fibres, produces in part the painful sensation
that we then have, and which we call hunger, a sensation
that should be distinguished from the general affection
that succeeds it, and which becomes truly a disease,
when abstinence has been too much prolonged. We
know that substances not nutritive then appease this sensation
without remedying the disease, when the stomach
is filled with them. I refer to the same kind of sensibility
the anxiety and distress which patients experience,
in whom we keep the bladder in permanent contraction
by an open sound in the urethra, which transmits the
urine as fast as it falls from the ureters. This sensation
does not resemble that of hunger, because the sensibility
of the bladder and that of the stomach being different,
their modifications cannot be the same. Thus each of
these two sensations is different from that of which the
muscles of animal life, for a long time contracted, become
the seat. I do not believe that the sensation of hunger
belongs solely to the cause I have pointed out, and which
others have not spoken of; but it cannot be denied that
it has much part in it. Who knows if, after a fever in
which the action of the heart has been for a long time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
accelerated, the weakness of the pulse which accompanies
convalescence, is not a sign of the lassitude in which its
fleshy fibres are, on account of the antecedent motion?
We know the painful sensation of fatigue which the
stomach experiences after the contractions of vomiting.</p>


<h5><i>Contractility.</i></h5>

<p>The animal contractility is foreign to the muscles of
organic life. To be convinced of this, we must recollect
that on the one hand this contractility always supposes
the influence of the brain and the nerves, to bring in
play the action of the muscle, and that on the other, the
brain, in order to exert this influence, must be excited by
the will, by stimulants or by sympathies. Now none of
these causes acting upon the brain, the organic muscles
cannot contract.</p>

<p>Every body knows that these muscles are essentially
involuntary. If some men have had the faculty of arresting
the motions of the heart, it is not upon this organ that
the brain has acted; the action of the diaphragm and the
intercostals has first been suspended; respiration has
ceased for a time; then consequently the circulation.</p>

<p>If we irritate the brain with a scalpel or any other
stimulant, the muscles of animal life become convulsed;
they are paralyzed if we compress this organ. Those of
organic life, on the contrary preserve in both cases their
natural degree of motion. The heart still continues to
beat, the intestines and stomach move some time after the
cerebral mass and spinal marrow have been taken away.
Who does not know that the circulation goes on very
well in acephalous fÅ“tuses; that after the blow that has
knocked down an animal, and rendered his whole voluntary
muscular system immoveable, the heart is still for a
long time agitated, the bladder rejects the urine, the rectum
expels the excrements, &amp;c. the stomach even sometimes
vomits up aliments? Opium, which benumbs the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
whole animal life, because it acts especially upon the brain
which is the centre of it, which paralyzes all the voluntary
muscles, leaves the others unaffected in their contractions.
Intoxication produced by wine exhibits the same
phenomenon. A man staggers after drinking; his limbs
refuse to carry him, and yet his heart beats with force;
his stomach often heaves and rejects the surplus fluids it
contains. All narcotic substances also produce this effect.</p>

<p>If from experiments we pass to observations on the
sick, we see that all cerebral affections are foreign to the
organic muscular system. Wounds of the head with depression,
fungi of the brain, effusions of blood, pus and
serum, apoplexy, &amp;c. affect exclusively the voluntary
muscles, the action of which they increase, weaken or
destroy. In the midst of this general derangement of animal
life, the organic remains unaffected. The paroxysm
of mania and malignant fever likewise proves this fact.
Who does not know that in this last the pulse is oftentimes
scarcely altered, that sometimes even it is slower?</p>

<p>Frequently in diseases of the head, there are spasmodic
vomitings; the action of the heart is accelerated in cerebral
inflammations, &amp;c. But these are sympathetic phenomena
which happen in the organic muscles, as they do
in all the other systems; they may not appear nor be developed;
a thousand irregularities are observed in their
progress. Whereas the contraction of the muscles of animal
life by affections of the brain is a constant, invariable
phenomenon, which nothing disturbs, and the development
of which nothing prevents, because the means of
communication are always the same between the affected
organ and the one that moves.</p>

<p>If in the examination of the phenomena relative to the
cerebral influence upon the organic muscles, we follow an
inverse order, that is to say, that in the affections of these
muscles we examine the state of the brain, we observe
the same independence; consider most vomitings, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
irregular motions of the intestines which take place in
diarrhÅ“as, those especially which form the iliac passion,
&amp;c.; observe the heart in the agitations of fevers, in the
irregular palpitations of which it becomes frequently the
seat, &amp;c.; in these derangements of the organic muscles,
you will very seldom find signs of lesions of the cerebral organ;
it is calm, while every thing is disordered in organic
life. Cullen thought that in syncope the action of the
brain ceased first, and that that of the heart was afterwards
consequently suspended. It is precisely the reverse in
the greatest number of cases. The heart, at first affected,
ceases to act; now its action being essential to that of
the brain, whether from the motion it communicates to
it, or from the red blood it sends, the functions of this
last are suddenly suspended and the whole animal life
ceases. This is remarkable especially in the syncopes
that arise from the passions, in those from hemorrhages,
polypi, great evacuations, &amp;c. I refer upon this subject
to my Treatise upon Life and Death.</p>

<p>If from the influence of the brain we pass to that of
the nerves, we find new proofs of the absence of animal
contractility in the organic muscles. The most of these
muscles receive, as we have seen, two species of nerves,
the one cerebral, the other from the ganglions.</p>

<p>The heart, the stomach, the rectum and the bladder are
evidently entered by the first species of nerves; now by
cutting, or irritating in any way the cardiac filaments of
the par vagum, the heart experiences no alteration from
it; its motion is neither retarded, nor accelerated. The
division of both branches of the par vagum is fatal, it is
true, but not until after some days; and I doubt whether
it is by the heart that death commences in this case. The
principal phenomena consequent upon this division show
a great embarrassment in the lungs, a great difficulty of
breathing; the circulation appears to be troubled only in
consequence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span></p>

<p>The same nerves going to the stomach, the same experiment
serves to prove the cerebral influence upon this
viscus. Now the division of that of one side is usually
nothing upon it; that of both soon produces a remarkable
derangement in it. But this derangement is wholly
different from that which follows the section of the nerve
of a muscle of animal life, which becomes suddenly immoveable,
whilst that on the contrary the stomach not
communicating with the brain except by the par vagum,
seems to acquire in an instant an increase of power; it
contracts and hence the spasmodic vomitings that are almost
always observed during the two or three days that
the animal survives the experiment, vomitings that I
have constantly noticed in dogs, and which Haller and
Cruikshank had before observed. It appears then from
this, that though the brain has a real influence upon the
stomach, this influence is of a nature wholly different
from that which it exerts upon the voluntary muscles.
I would observe however that the irritation of one branch
of the par vagum, or of both, makes the stomach immediately
contract, as happens in a voluntary muscle when
we irritate its nerve. It is necessary, in order to make
this experiment, to open the abdomen of a living animal,
and afterwards to irritate the eighth pair in the region of
the neck, so as to have in sight the organ that we make
contract.</p>

<p>The bladder and the rectum appear to approximate the
voluntary muscles, in their relation with the brain, more
than the stomach and the heart. We know that falls on
the sacrum, from which arises a shock of the inferior part
of the spinal marrow, produce retention of urine; that
they strike, as it were, this organ with the same paralysis
as the inferior extremities, which then also cease to move.
Yet as the bladder is very powerfully assisted in its functions
by the abdominal muscles, by the levator ani and
other voluntary muscles which surround it, the immobility<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
of these muscles contributes much to the inability to evacuate
the urine. That which makes me think so, is that,
1st, the irritation of the spinal marrow towards its inferior
part which puts in motion all the voluntary muscles
of the inferior extremities and of the pelvis, does not produce
any effect upon this part. I have convinced myself
of this fact many times upon dogs and guinea-pigs. 2d.
By irritating the nerves coming from the sacral foramina
and going to the bladder, nerves that it is often very difficult
to find, on account of the blood in an animal recently
killed, I have seen this muscle remain immoveable. On
the contrary all these nerves having been cut, the injection
of a fluid slightly stimulant makes it contract with
force. 3d. In experiments upon living animals, as in surgical
operations, the violence of the pain which sometimes
produces spasmodic contractions of all the muscles of animal
life, frequently occasions an involuntary discharge of
urine. Now in these cases it is not the bladder that is
convulsed; for if in an experiment this phenomenon takes
place, open the abdominal parietes, in an instant the flow
of urine ceases, because on the one hand the muscles of
these parietes cannot act upon the intestines and press
them against the bladder, and because on the other the
levator ani which contracts and raises this organ, has no
resisting point against which it can compress it above.
Observe in fact that in strong jets of urine, the bladder is
placed between two opposite efforts, one superior, which
is the gastric viscera pressed by the diaphragm and the
abdominal muscles, the other inferior, which is especially
the levator ani which acts by contracting from below
above, whilst the opposite effort acts from above below;
now these two efforts are evidently under the cerebral influence.
I have very frequently had occasion to observe
the bladder full of urine in a living animal whose abdomen
was opened; I have never seen it contract with sufficient
violence to expel the fluid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span></p>

<p>I do not deny but that the bladder, by the nerves it
receives from the sacral plexuses, is to a certain extent a
voluntary muscle; but I say that it is principally by forces
accessory to its own and necessary to its functions, that
it is subjected to the will; that the animal contractility is
much greater in its functions than the sensible organic
contractility. How then is the urine retained in this organ,
or expelled from its cavity at will? In this way;
when the urine falls into the bladder, and is there on the
one hand but a short time, and on the other only in small
quantity, it is not then an irritant sufficiently powerful to
produce the exercise of the sensible organic contractility.
The effort which the bladder makes is so small, that it
cannot overcome the resistance of the urethra, which
being shut by the contractility of texture, must be dilated
by the impulse communicated to the urine. In order to
void this fluid, there must then be added to the contraction
of the bladder that of the surrounding voluntary
muscles; now the least effort of these muscles is sufficient
to overcome the resistance of the urethra. But if
the urine is in great quantity in the bladder, and it has
acquired by remaining in it a long time that deep colour
which indicates the concentration of its principles, then
the irritation that it produces on the organ brings powerfully
into action the sensible organic contractility; the
bladder contracts, and in spite of the animal, there is an
evacuation of urine.</p>

<p>In the rectum, in which the excrements have not a
long canal, but only a simple opening to pass, this is furnished
with a sphincter which is wanting in the urethra.
This sphincter habitually closed must be dilated by the
impulse communicated to the excrements. When they
are in the rectum a short time and in small quantity, the
sensible organic contractility is not brought into action
with sufficient power to expel them; it requires the
action of the neighbouring voluntary muscles. If this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
action is not determined by the influx from the brain, the
excrements remain in the intestines; hence how, for
some time, we retain them at will. But as they increase
in quantity, and become more acrid by remaining and
consequently more irritating, then the sensible organic
contractility strongly brought into action, empties the intestine
involuntarily. If the sphincter, which is voluntary,
is paralyzed, there will be incontinence, because no
resistance is opposed to the tendency of the rectum to
contract, a tendency which though feeble as long as it is
but partly filled, is however always real.</p>

<p>From what we have said, it appears evidently that the
bladder and rectum, though receiving cerebral nerves,
are yet less influenced by the brain than it at first view
appears, and that there is evidently between them and
the voluntary muscles a very great difference. They are
not mixt, as it is called; they approach the organic muscles
infinitely nearer than the others; I doubt even whether
if no accessory power acted with and compressed them,
the mind could by the nerves which come from the sacral
plexuses, make them contract at will. I have never seen
an animal void his excrements when the abdomen was
open.</p>

<p>Let us conclude from all that has been thus far said,
that the cerebral nerves which go to the organic muscles
have upon them an influence which by no means resembles
that of the cerebral nerves going to the muscles of
animal life. I am ignorant moreover of the nature of
this influence.</p>

<p>All the organic muscles receive nerves from the ganglions,
both the preceding ones which are also penetrated
by the cerebral nerves, and the small intestines, and the
cÅ“cum, colour, &amp;c. which are exclusively pervaded by
them. Now by cutting, tying or irritating in any manner
these nerves, by stimulating the ganglions from which
they go, by destroying or burning them with a concen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>trated
acid or alkali, the muscle remains in its natural
state; its contractions are neither accelerated nor retarded.</p>

<p>I have not been contented with ordinary agents in convincing
myself of the deficiency of real action of the
nerves upon the organic muscles; a fact, which all good
physiologists have always admitted, notwithstanding the
opinions hazarded by some physicians who apply the
vague term of nervous influence to organs which are not
susceptible of it.</p>

<p>I have then employed galvanism, and I am convinced
that it has very little, almost no power, in putting into
action muscular contractions in organic life, whilst it is
the most powerful agent in animal life. I shall not here
relate my experiments upon this subject; they will be
read in my Researches upon Death.</p>

<p>We can conclude from all that precedes, that the cerebral
and nervous influence upon the organic muscles is
not known to us; that it does not act as upon the voluntary
muscles. It is however real to a certain extent, since
it is necessary that the nerves which enter into the composition
of these muscles should be of some use; but we
are ignorant of this use.</p>


<h5><i>Organic Properties.</i></h5>

<p>The organic sensibility is strongly characterized in the
muscles of which we are treating. Before the sensible
organic contractility is developed in them, it is necessary
that this should be put in action. But as these two properties
are not separated, as in their exercise they always
succeed each other, what we are going to say of sensible
organic contractility will apply also to the sensibility of
the same nature.</p>

<p>Insensible organic contractility or tone, exists in the
muscular system, to a degree necessary for its nutrition;
but it does not exhibit in it any thing peculiar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span></p>

<p>It is the sensible organic contractility that is the predominant
property in this system, all the functions of
which rest almost entirely upon this contractility, as all
the functions of the preceding muscular system are derived
as it were from the animal contractility. We shall
now examine more in detail this essential property, with
regard to which physiology owes so much to the illustrious
Haller. We can consider it in three relations; 1st, in
the stimuli; 2d, in the organs; 3d, in the action of the
first upon the second.</p>


<h5><i>Of the Sensible Organic Contractility considered in
relation to Stimuli.</i></h5>

<p>Stimuli are natural or artificial. The action of the first
is continual during life; upon them turn in part the organic
phenomena; they place in action the muscles, which
without them would be immoveable; they are as it were
to these organs what pendulums are to our machines;
they give the impulse. The second can hardly have effect
until after death, or in our experiments.</p>


<h5><i>Natural Stimuli.</i></h5>

<p>These stimuli are blood for the heart, urine for the
bladder, aliments and excrements for the gastric organs.
Every organic muscle has a body, which, habitually in
contact with it, supports its motions, as every animal muscle
habitually in relation with the brain, borrows from it
its power of motion. The natural stimuli support the
organs at the same degree of mobility while they remain
the same. All things being equal on the part of the organs,
the pulse does not vary, the digestive periods continue
for the same length of time, the intervals between
the excretion of urine are equal, whilst the blood, the
chyle or the urine exhibit no differences. But as these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
substances experience an infinite number of varieties, the
organs preserving the same degree of sensibility, have
yet frequent changes in their motion.</p>

<p>At the instant chyle enters the blood during digestion,
the pulse changes, because the heart is differently irritated.
We observe the same phenomenon under different
circumstances; 1st, in re-absorptions in which pus
goes into the mass of blood; 2d, in the injection of different
fluids in the veins, injections that were so frequently
made in the last age, at the period of experiments
upon transfusion, and which I have also had occasion to
make with other views which I shall mention; 3d, in
inflammatory diseases in which the blood takes a peculiar
character that is yet but little known, and which occasions
the formation of the pleuritic buff; 4th, in various
other affections, in which the nature of this fluid is remarkably
altered; 5th, in the passage of the red blood
into the system with black blood. I have observed that
in putting a curved tube into the carotid of one side and
the jugular of the opposite of a large dog, so that one
forces blood into the other, the passage of the red blood
into the veins is not fatal like that of the black blood into
the arteries; but there is almost always at first an acceleration
of the motions of the heart.</p>

<p>The influence of the degeneracy of the fluids in diseases
has no doubt been exaggerated; too frequent a
source of morbid derangements has been placed in this
portion of the economy. But it cannot be denied, that
according to the different alterations that the fluids exhibit,
they may be capable of exciting differently the solids
that contain them. We know that in the same individual,
and with the same mass of aliments, digestion varies from
one day to another in the duration of its periods; that
some aliments prolong and others accelerate it; that some
remain very long in the stomach, as it is said, and others
as it were only pass through it. Now in all these cases<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
the organ remains the same, the fluid only varies. According
as the kidney secretes urine more or less acrid and
consequently more or less irritating, the bladder retains
it for a longer or shorter time. Such is oftentimes its
stimulating qualities, that the moment it comes into this
organ it is involuntarily rejected. Shall I speak of emetics
and evacuants by the intestinal canal, the effects of
which are so variable? We know that the words drastic,
purgative, laxative, &amp;c. indicate the different degrees of
the stimulating qualities which certain substances introduced
into the alimentary canal exhibit, degrees which
are to be considered abstractedly from those of the sensibility
of the organs; this in fact can be such, that a laxative
may produce greater effects than a drastic purge.</p>

<p>Not only the quality, but also the quantity of the fluids
contained in the organic muscles, has an influence upon
their contractility. 1st. The word plethora is certainly
employed too loosely in medicine; but we cannot doubt
that the state which it expresses sometimes exists; now
the more blood there is in the heart, the more are its
contractions accelerated. 2d. I have many times made
transfusion in dogs, whether with a view to that alone,
or in researches relative to respiration and circulation.
Now I have always observed, that by not opening a vein,
to empty the blood as fast as the external jugular receives
it (for I always choose this vein for the experiment) by
thus producing consequently an artificial plethora, I have,
I say, always observed that the motion of the heart was
accelerated. I have even seen the eye of a dog become
bright and as it were inflamed; in others this phenomenon
has not been observed. 3d. We know that in
running, in which all the muscles by contracting press
out from all sides the venous blood contained in their texture,
this which enters the heart in abundance, makes
it palpitate powerfully. 4th. There is not doubt but
that the quantity of urine and excrements as much and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
more than their quality, is for the bladder and the rectum,
a cause of involuntary contraction. 5th. We know the
serious consequences that arise from giving emetics and
cathartics in too large doses. 6th. A glass of tepid water
often does not produce vomiting when a pint will bring
it on powerfully, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>


<h5><i>Artificial Stimuli.</i></h5>

<p>The artificial stimuli are in general all the bodies in
nature. Such is in fact the essence of organic contractility,
that a muscle because it is in contact with a body
to which it is not accustomed, instantly contracts. If the
muscles are not irritated by the organs that surround them
and with which they are in relation, it is because habit
has blunted the sensation which arises from this relation.
But when these organs change their modifications, when
extracted from the body of the animal, they become cold,
and are afterwards applied to the organic muscles laid
bare, they will make them contract.</p>

<p>Caloric, by its absence which constitutes cold, as by its
presence from which arises heat, can equally excite the
muscles and in general all the organs. At the instant we
open the thorax or the pericardium of a living animal,
the heart is agitated with a suddenly increased force; it
is because the air acts upon it, and it passes from the
temperature of the body to another which is different.
All the aeriform fluids, light, all fluids, &amp;c. are stimuli of
the muscles. If we see the heart emptied of blood, the
stomach and intestines deprived of the substances that
ordinarily enter them, contract with more or less force
when they have been taken out of the body, it is because
the surrounding medium, and the substances with which
it is charged, contribute to produce this effect; they are
then the stimuli of these organs.</p>

<p>In general the artificial stimuli act in different ways;
1st, by their simple contact; 2d, by tearing or cutting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
mechanically the fibres; 3d, by tending to combine with
them; 4th, there are some of whose mode of action we
are completely ignorant; such for example is electricity.</p>

<p>When the stimuli act only by simple contact, the fluids
are, all things being equal, more efficacious than the
solids, because they stimulate by a greater number of
points; as they irritate not only the surfaces of the organ,
but penetrate also into the interstices of the fibres. The
solids produce an effect in proportion to the extent of
their excitement, to the greater or less pressure that they
exert, to their density, their softness, &amp;c. They are
almost always fluid substances that nature employs for
stimuli in the ordinary state.</p>

<p>Tearing is a mode of excitement more active than contact.
The heart, the intestines often inert when they are
only touched by the scalpel, contract powerfully when
the point of it excites them. Cutting produces a less
sensible effect than tearing. Cut transversely, the fibres
oscillate and are agitated only by the sensible organic
contractility, whilst by the contractility of texture they
experience an evident retraction.</p>

<p>Chemical excitement is, in the greatest number of cases,
the most advantageous; but it is necessary here to distinguish
that which belongs to the horny hardening, from
that which is the effect of irritability brought into action.
1st. Plunge a frog without skin and alive into a concentrated
acid; instantly every thing is disorganized; the
reagent acts so strongly, that we can distinguish neither
horny hardening nor contractility. 2d. Weaken the acid
a little and plunge into it, the inferior extremities only
of a frog; in an instant they stiffen by the contraction of
the extensors, which overcome the flexors; for in this
experiment, this is almost a constant phenomenon; withdraw
the animal; its thighs remain immoveable, life has
been extinguished in them; the contraction that has come
on is a horny hardening, and not a vital phenomenon. A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
dead frog plunged into the same liquor experiences the
same phenomenon. 3d. Weaken the acid still more; the
instant the animal is plunged into it its limbs contract;
but relaxation succeeds the contractions; these are alternate
motions; it is the irritability that begins to be put
into action. Yet if the acid is not very weak, some
marks of the horny hardening still remain, and the animal
has a stiffness in the motions of the inferior extremities,
the evident result of the first degree of this horny
hardening. 4th. Finally, if the acid is very weak, it becomes
a simple irritant which puts in action the sensible
organic contractility, without altering the texture of the
fibres; the animal after coming out of the fluid preserves
the same power of motion.</p>

<p>These experiments which it would be easy to multiply
upon animals with warm blood, but which I have never
attempted upon them, evidently show what belongs to
the horny hardening, and what is the effect of vital contraction.
Yet there is not an exact limit between them,
and there is one degree of weakness of the acid in which
these two causes of motions are confounded.</p>

<p>There is a mode of excitement to which authors have
not paid attention; it may be called negative; it is that
of which I spoke just now on the subject of caloric, the
privation of which is oftentimes a very active stimulant.
In the different experiments that I have had occasion to
make, this has frequently struck me. Apply a stimulant
to a muscle, it contracts; but at the end of some time
the motion ceases, though the contact continues; remove
the stimulant, the motion frequently returns in an instant.
In general, nothing is more common in the heart, the intestines,
&amp;c. than their contractions ceasing under the continued
action of a stimulant, and returning instantly upon
its absence. I confess that this phenomenon is not as invariable
and constant as that of the contraction produced
by the application of the stimulus which succeeds a state<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
of non-excitement; but this happens very often. We
might say that the organic sensibility is in this case like
the animal, that every new state affects it, whether it be
positive or negative. The passage from non-excitement
to excitement is more lively; but the opposite passage is
not less when it is sudden. Moreover this manner of
describing the sensible organic contractility in exercise,
deserves some further experiments.</p>


<h5><i>Of the Sensible Organic Contractility considered in
relation to the Organs.</i></h5>

<p>The sensible organic contractility, considered in the
organ in which it has its seat, exhibits numerous varieties
which are relative; 1st, to the diversity of texture; 2d,
to age; 3d, to sex; 4th, to temperament, &amp;c.</p>


<h5><i>First Variety. Diversity of the Muscular Texture.</i></h5>

<p>The animal contractility is everywhere the same in the
voluntary muscles, because their organization is uniform.
All things being equal as to the number and length of
the fibres, the phenomena of contraction are exactly the
same everywhere; here, on the contrary, the varieties of
texture inevitably produce varieties in the vital properties.</p>

<p>Each involuntary muscle is at first especially in relation
with the fluid which ordinarily acts as its stimulus.
The blood alone can regularly support the motions of the
heart. Let this fluid be altered in any manner, the contractions
become irregular. All foreign substances forced
into the veins produce this phenomenon. The urine,
which supports with harmony the motions of the bladder,
would disturb those of the heart, if it circulated in its
cavities. The blood, more soft in appearance than the
urine, can agitate convulsively the bladder, if it happens
to be in it. I took care with Desault of a patient affected
for a long time with retention of urine, and whom he had
cut for a very large stone. After the operation, the urine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
remained stagnant in the bladder as long as it was alone,
but when a little blood entered this organ, it contracted
involuntarily and the bloody urine was evacuated. The
excrements, which could continue for a long time in the
rectum without making it contract, would make the
stomach heave in an instant, &amp;c. All these phenomena
are to be referred to varieties of sensibility of the mucous
membranes, varieties which we shall notice again. They
prove evidently that each muscle has a degree of organic
contractility which is peculiar to it, and that this or that
fluid of the economy can exclusively, in a natural state,
put it in exercise in a regular manner.</p>

<p>Foreign fluids exhibit the same result; the emetic
which makes the stomach contract, is injected with impunity
into the bladder; purgatives do not produce vomiting,
&amp;c. This relation of foreign fluids with the sensible
organic contractility takes place, whether, as in the
preceding case, these fluids are applied to the mucous
surfaces corresponding to the muscles, or whether they
come to the muscles by the circulation, as the experiments
have proved which were made in the last age upon
the introduction of medicinal substances into the veins;
experiments of which Haller has collected a great number
of results. We have seen in these experiments, the
circulation present to all the organs sometimes an emetic,
and the stomach alone contracts; sometimes a purgative,
and the intestines only enter into action, &amp;c. Taken in
by cutaneous absorption, medicinal substances occasion
the same phenomenon. Applied by friction, purgatives,
emetics, &amp;c. do not make all the organic muscles contract,
though the circulation presents them to all, but only those
with which their sensibility is in relation.</p>

<p>In the various affections of which they are the seat, we
see the organic muscles having each a peculiar mode of
irritation answer to each stimulus, and remaining deaf, if
we may so say, to the voice of the others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span></p>


<h5><i>Second Variety. Age.</i></h5>

<p>Age modifies wonderfully the sensible organic contractility.
In infancy it is very evident; the muscles
answer with extreme ease to the stimuli; the bladder
retains the urine with difficulty; children void it in sleep
involuntarily; the heart contracts with a rapidity of which
the pulse is the measure; all the digestive phenomena
are more prompt; hence there is less interval between
the returns of hunger. It is a phenomenon analogous to
that of the voluntary muscles, in which the rapidity of
the motions is found, in the first age, connected with their
small degree of force.</p>

<p>After infancy, the susceptibility of the muscles to
answer to their stimuli, is constantly diminishing; thus
all the great phenomena of organic life are continually becoming
slower. The number of pulsations, the duration
of digestion, the longer continuance of the urine, &amp;c. are
the thermometer of this slowness.</p>

<p>In old age the whole is weakened; the action of the
organic muscles gradually diminishes. Those of the bladder
and rectum are the most exposed to lose their contractile
faculty; hence the retention of urine, which is a
frequent companion of old age; hence also the accumulation
of fecal matters above the anus, a disease almost as
common as the first at this age of life, though it has
received less attention from practitioners. Rich people
and those accustomed to the luxury of the table are
especially subject to it. I have seen much of it, as much
even as of retention of urine, in the last year of the
practice of Desault. The intestines and the stomach languish
more slowly in their functions. It is the heart
which resists the most; it is the ultimum moriens, as it
has been the first in exercise; the duration of its pulsations
measures exactly the duration of organic life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span></p>


<h5><i>Third Variety. Temperament.</i></h5>

<p>Temperament modifies in a remarkable manner organic
contractility. We know that in some the pulsations are
more frequent, the digestive and urinary phenomena more
rapid; that in others, every thing is marked by more
slowness in organic life; now these varieties have evidently
their primitive source in the varieties of the contractility
of the heart, the stomach, the intestines, &amp;c.
which have under this relation a great influence in the
difference of the temperaments. With respect to this
there are two essential observations to be made; 1st.
The varieties of force of the organic muscles do not
always coincide with those of the muscles of animal life.
Thus we see an individual with feebly developed exterior
forms, with an evident weakness of the muscles of the
extremities, whilst the activity of digestion, of the urinary
evacuations, &amp;c. announces the greatest energy in the
sensible organic contractility. I would remark with
regard to this, that the heart is more frequently in relation
of force with the external muscles than the stomach,
the intestines and the bladder. A full pulse, well developed,
is usually found with an athletic constitution;
whilst often this constitution is united in the same subject
to a feeble gastric system, and especially the force of this
gastric system is frequently connected with external
weakness. This fact, which the different temperaments
demonstrate to us in man, is evident in the series of animals.
Those who, like the carnivorous ones, have a very
powerful animal muscular system, have the parietes of
the gastric cavities like membranes. These parietes are
strong in the herbivorous classes; they become very conspicuous
in the gallinaceous. In general, mastication over
which the animal contractility always presides, is in animals
in an inverse ratio of the force of trituration of the
stomach, over which the sensible organic contractility
presides.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span></p>

<p>2d. The varieties of this property, relative to temperaments,
exhibit another phenomenon almost always foreign
to the animal muscular system. In fact in this the varieties
are always general; we are able by exercise to
strengthen this or that muscular region; but the differences
of forces which are natural, always influence the
whole system. The arms and the legs, the thorax and
the abdomen are uniformly contractile in the different
divisions of the muscles that belong to them. On the
contrary, it is rare to see this uniformity in the involuntary
muscles. One almost always predominates over the
others; sometimes it is the heart, sometimes the stomach
and sometimes the bladder. The gastric viscera even are
frequently not all at the same level as to force. The
stomach is feeble when the intestines preserve their ordinary
action; and reciprocally the intestines too contractile
expel immediately fecal matters and thus produce a
diarrhÅ“a, though the stomach may perform its functions
well. This essential difference in the two muscular systems
arises from the circumstance that the contractility of
one depends upon a common centre, the brain; whilst
that of the other on the contrary has its principle insulated
in each organ in which it exists.</p>


<h5><i>Fourth Variety. Sex.</i></h5>

<p>Women in general resemble children in the phenomena
of sensible organic contractility. The weakness of the
motions coincides with their greater rapidity in this sex,
all whose internal muscles, like the external, are more
delicate and less strongly developed than in man. It
might be said that the contractile power of the womb has
been formed at the expense of the forces of all the other
organs. In experiments, females give results much less
decided and always less durable than males. The motions
of the heart, the stomach, the intestines, &amp;c. cease sooner;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
these motions are less; it requires stronger stimuli to
produce them, &amp;c.</p>


<h5><i>Fifth Variety. Season and Climate.</i></h5>

<p>In winter and in cold climates, in which the cutaneous
organ contracted, and having as it were the horny hardness
from the impression of the surrounding air, has but a
feeble action, all the internal functions more active, require
more energy in the forces that preside over them;
all the digestive, urinary and circulatory phenomena are
more evident. I do not know that there has yet been
made any comparative experiments upon irritability in
the different seasons; but I am persuaded that they would
give different results.</p>


<h5><i>Sensible Organic Contractility considered in relation
to the Action of Stimuli upon the Organs.</i></h5>

<p>We have just described separately the stimulant and
the organ stimulated; each being separate there is no
effect upon the sensible organic contractility; from their
union alone results the exercise of this property. What
happens in this union? We know not. To wish to know
it, would be to wish to know how one body attracts
another, how an acid combines with an alkali, &amp;c. In
attraction, affinity and irritability, we can only trace the
phenomena to the action of bodies upon each other. This
action is the utmost limit of our researches.</p>

<p>But that which ought not to escape us here is, that in
this last property, the action is never immediate. There
is always between the stimulus and the organ something
intermediate which receives the irritation; this intermediate
organ is a delicate membrane and continuous with
that of the arteries for the heart; it is a mucous surface
for the gastric viscera and the bladder. This intermediate
organ is more susceptible of receiving excitement than
the muscle itself. I have uniformly observed that by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
irritating the internal surface of the heart, its contractions
are greater, than by laying its texture bare externally by
removing its serous covering and afterwards stimulating
it. The same is true with regard to the organic muscles
of the abdomen.</p>

<p>Is there between the intermediate organ excited and
the organ which contracts, any nervous communications
that transmit the impression? I think not, the cellular
texture is sufficient. In fact the serous surfaces and the
organic muscles have only this texture as a means of
union. The life of the first is in no way connected with
that of the others, since they often leave them as we shall
see, and yet they can transmit excitement to them. The
pericardium and the peritoneum, irritated in their portion
corresponding with the organ that we wish to move, produce
a contraction in it. This fact is known to all those
who have made the least experiment; it is almost always
in this way that we stimulate the heart, the stomach, the
intestines, the bladder, &amp;c. By carrying the stimulus
over the serous surface but very lightly, and so as not to
communicate the motion to the fleshy fibres, we obtain a
result. Yet simple contact is not sufficient to transmit
the irritation; for example, by leaving the external layer
of the pericardium applied to the heart and afterwards
irritating it, the organ remains immoveable. If we separate
the peritoneum from above the bladder, so as to
break all the cellular adhesions, and afterwards reapply
and stimulate it, the same immobility is observed.</p>

<p>When the intermediate organ that receives the excitement
is diseased, the contractility is uniformly altered.
The same stimulus produces slow or rapid contractions,
according as the affection raises or diminishes the sensibility
of this intermediate organ. A slight inflammation
of the exterior of the bladder produces a kind of incontinence
of urine; that of the intestines occasions diarrhÅ“a,
&amp;c. &amp;c. On the contrary, old catarrhs of the blad<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>der,
the affections in which weakness of the mucous surface
of this organ predominates, are the frequent causes
of retention.</p>

<p>I would observe that the existence of this intermediate
organ is a remarkable difference between the sensible
organic contractility and the insensible, for this organ
does not exist in this last, in which the same system receives
the impression and reacts upon the body that has
produced it; for example, in the glandular, serous, cutaneous
systems, &amp;c. the fluid which enters them for secretion
or exhalation produces in them the sensation, which
is instantly followed by the reaction. In the sensible
contractility on the contrary, one system feels and another
is moved. This kind of mobility is less removed
from that of animal life, in which the organs of the senses
and those of the motion being wholly different, are very
distant from each other.</p>


<h5><i>Sensible Organic Contractility considered in relation
to its duration after Death.</i></h5>

<p>This duration is longer than that of the animal contractility.
When the spinal marrow is irritated, the external
muscles remain immoveable, whilst the internal
ones are still in activity. There have been so many examples
related of this duration, Haller has multiplied experiments
so much upon this point, that there is no occasion
for me to give proofs here of a fact of which no one
can any longer doubt. To this duration are owing the
evacuations of fecal matter and urine which often take
place an instant after death; the vomitings that are observed
in some subjects, if not in as evident a manner
as during life, at least sufficient to raise the aliments into
the mouth of the dead body, which is often completely
filled with them, as I have frequently seen.</p>

<p>It is necessary, in relation to this duration, as in relation
to that of the animal contractility, to distinguish two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
species of death; 1st, those that take place suddenly;
2d, those which are the consequence of long disease.</p>

<p>In every sudden death, produced either by a violent
lesion of the brain, as in apoplexy, concussion, compression,
effusion, &amp;c. or by an affection of the heart, as in
syncope, a wound, or a ruptured aneurism; or by a cessation
of the action of the lungs, as in asphyxia from deleterious
gases, a vacuum, submersion, &amp;c. the duration of
contractility is very evident; general death comes on
first, then the organs die partially; each vital force is
afterwards successively extinguished.</p>

<p>In every kind of death slowly produced, in all those
especially which are preceded by a disease of weakness,
it is the partial death of each organ that first takes place;
each vital force is weakened and extinguished, gradually,
before the cessation of them as a whole, which constitutes
general death, comes on; when this death takes place,
none of the lives peculiar to each organ remains, whilst
most of these lives continue for a longer or shorter time
after sudden death.</p>

<p>We cannot make these experiments upon dead bodies
which we rarely have in the hospitals till fifteen hours or
more after death; but by killing dogs by hunger, which,
when long continued, becomes a real disease that lasts in
these animals eight, ten and even twelve days, I have seen
the contractility entirely extinguished at the moment of
death. Dogs have been often brought to me affected with
different diseases, especially three years since when there
was a kind of epidemic among these animals; now by
opening them at the instant of death, by killing them
even some time before and thus producing a sudden death
wholly different from that which happens in the sound
state in which all the parts are uninjured in their functions
and consequently in their vital forces, I have always
seen a constant absence of contractility, or at least so
greatly weakened that it appeared to be nothing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span></p>

<p>Many physiologists have spoken of a general convulsion
which comes on in the organic muscles at the instant
of death, of a rising of the heart, the stomach, the intestines,
&amp;c. This excess of action is sometimes real in
sudden deaths, in those especially that we produce for
our experiments; it is very rare in deaths preceded by a
long disease in which the patient is extinguished, as it
were, insensibly, and passes gradually from life to death.
It is a fault common to almost all authors, to generalize
too much the facts observed under certain circumstances.
Many false consequences are the results of it.</p>


<h5><i>Sympathies.</i></h5>

<p>No organ receives more easily the influence of others,
than the organic muscles; all however are not equally
susceptible of it. The heart occupies the first rank in
this respect; then comes the stomach, then the intestines,
and finally the bladder. It is in this order that we shall
now examine this influence.</p>

<p>It is a remarkable phenomenon, that every kind of
affection in any degree strong, arising in the economy,
alters immediately the motions of the heart. The least
wound, oftentimes the slightest pain are sufficient to produce
derangements in it; now these derangements are of
two kinds; sometimes its action is arrested for a moment;
hence syncopes, a mode of derangement which happens
especially in violent and sudden pains. The vulgar expression
which is employed in these cases, viz. "my heart
is failing," is perfectly true. Sometimes, and this is the
most common case, this action is accelerated; hence the
febrile motions so frequent in all the local affections, motions
purely sympathetic and which cease when the affection
disappears. In many local inflammations, the evil is
too circumscribed to admit an obstacle to the course of the
blood, an obstacle, which according to Boerhaave, forces
the heart to redouble its action to surmount it; besides<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
when there is no swelling, but only pain in the part, and
the febrile motion comes on, it is there clearly a sympathetic
phenomenon. The increase of the action of the
heart may depend no doubt upon a foreign substance,
which, mixed with the blood, alters and renders it more
irritating; it may be owing to an affection of the substance
of the organ which disposes it to be more irritable; but
it is certainly very often sympathetic, and depends upon
that unknown relation which connects all our organs,
upon that consensus which links together all their actions,
and places them in reciprocal dependance.</p>

<p>I shall say as much of the stomach; though its sympathetic
reaction may not be altogether as frequent as that
of the heart, yet it becomes very evident under many
circumstances. Most local affections, especially inflammations
are accompanied with sympathetic vomitings.
Various fevers have in their commencement similar
vomitings. It is in the hospitals especially that we frequently
observe these phenomena. Many physicians
have not considered these vomitings as merely sympathetic,
but as the index of a bilious affection, founded on
this, that bile is then almost always thrown up. But in
all the animals that I have opened, I have almost always
seen the stomach when empty containing a certain quantity
of this fluid which had flowed back from the duodenum;
other authors have also made similar observations;
so that it appears that in the state of vacuity, the
existence of bile in the stomach is a natural phenomenon.
Hence it is not astonishing, that in the commencement of
diseases, and even in their course, the stomach being
sympathetically excited and thus becoming the seat of
vomiting, more or less of this fluid should be thrown up.
It would be brought up even in health if vomiting is then
excited by an emetic; this is what sometimes happens in
the morning when the stomach is empty, if any cause
foreign to an affection of the liver, as the sight of a dis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>gusting
object, produces vomiting; the bile then comes
out like every thing else that is contained in the stomach.
I do not say that oftentimes the liver being sympathetically
excited in the commencement of diseases, does not
furnish more bile, that this superabundant bile flowing
into the stomach, does not make this viscus contract; but
certainly this is not most commonly the case; we vomit
bile as we discharge it by the anus, because it is found in
the stomach and intestines, and not because it is superabundant.
If vomiting was a natural function, the bilious
evacuations in this way would be as natural as the greenish
tinge of the excrements, which is always found in a
state of health. We see then, from this, that the bilious
vomitings are, in many cases, purely accessory, and that
the essential phenomenon is the sympathetic contraction
of the stomach.</p>

<p>In the case of which I have just spoken there is no gastric
difficulty; the sympathetic alteration of the stomach
only extends to the fleshy fibres. But most frequently
this gastric difficulty appears at the beginning of diseases
in which there is local affection; sand-like substances are
vomited up; it is because then the organ essentially affected,
the lungs for example, if it is in a peripneumony, has
acted sympathetically not only on the fleshy fibres, but
also upon the mucous membrane. This excited increases
its secretion; hence these sand-like substances, which are
nothing but the mucous juices mixed with the gastric
fluid and with the bile; now the presence of these substances
is often sufficient to make the stomach contract,
and produce vomiting which expels them.</p>

<p>From this it is evident that there can be sympathetic
vomitings without gastric difficulty, and sympathetic gastric
difficulty with a vomiting immediately produced. In
the first case the fleshy fibres feel the sympathetic influence
of the affected organ; in the second it is the mucous
membrane. But how, when the lungs, the pleura, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
skin, &amp;c. being affected, does the stomach come into
action? I have said that the word sympathy was only a
veil for our ignorance in respect to the relations of the
organs to each other. Vomitings produced by erysipelas,
phlegmon, pleurisy, peripneumony, &amp;c. are then most
often an effect exactly analogous to the increase of the
action of the heart, which produces fever. They resemble
the cerebral derangement from which arises delirium,
a derangement which is much more rare, &amp;c. All these
phenomena indicate that the other organs feel by reaction
the state of that which is affected, &amp;c. Physicians who
have not viewed all these phenomena in a great and general
manner, have confined their treatment to too narrow
bounds. Much attention was formerly paid to the sympathetic
derangement of the heart, and bleeding was much
practised in the beginning of diseases; for some years
past much regard has been had to the sympathetic derangement
of the stomach, and emetics are frequently
given; perhaps before long, more attention will be given
to the weights of the head, pains in that part, watchfulness,
drowsiness, &amp;c. which are very common sympathetic
symptoms, and the treatment will be directed to the
brain. In these varieties judicious physicians will regard
all these phenomena in a general manner; they will see
in all a proof of that general agreement which disposes
together all the functions, which connects all and thus
connects their derangements; they will see each organ
rise up, as it were against the evil which is introduced
into the economy, and each react in its own way; they
will see these reactions producing effects wholly different,
according to the organ reacting, fever arising from the
reaction of the heart, delirium, drowsiness, watchfulness,
convulsions, &amp;c. from that of the brain, vomiting from
that of the stomach, diarrhÅ“a from that of the intestines,
gastric and intestinal derangements, foulness of the tongue
from those of the mucous membranes, overflowings of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
bile from that of the liver, &amp;c. Thus in a machine in
which the whole is united and connected together, if one
part is deranged all the others are so also. We should
laugh at the mechanist who attempted to mend but one
of these pieces, and neglected to repair the local derangement
from which all those arose which the machine
exhibits. Let us not laugh at the physician who attacks
only a single symptom, without combating the disease, of
which he oftentimes knows not the principle, though he
knows that this principle exists; but let us laugh at him,
if he attaches to his treatment an importance which is
nothing compared with that of the disease.</p>

<p>The intestines next to the stomach are the most often
sympathetically affected in diseases. The bladder is the
organic muscle that is the last to feel the influences that
go from the diseased organ; this sometimes however
happens. In fevers, we know that retentions of urine
from sympathetic and temporary paralysis, are not very
rare; incontinence of urine is less often seen.</p>


<h5><i>Character of the Vital Properties.</i></h5>

<p>We see from what has been said, that the vital properties
are very active in the organic muscles, especially as
it respects contractility. These muscles are really during
life, in constant action: they receive with great ease the
influence of other organs. Their vital properties are altered
with the greatest promptness, especially that which I
have just pointed out; for the insensible contractility is
rarely altered in them, because it does not perform an
essential part. Observe in fact that the morbid derangements
of an organ affect always the predominant vital
force of that organ. Animal contractility is frequently
altered in the preceding system; in this it is the sensible
organic contractility. On the contrary, the insensible
being very small, the phenomena over which it presides
remain always nearly the same; nutrition is always uni<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>form;
lesions of the muscular texture are rare; when
they take place, it is rather by communication, as in cancers
of the stomach, in which the disease begins upon
the mucous surface, and in which the fleshy fibres are
only consequently affected. The heart and the womb are
the muscles that are the most subject to these morbid
alterations; yet in the first they belong oftener to the internal
membrane than to the fleshy fibres themselves.
On the contrary in the systems in which the sensible organic
contractility is incessantly in action, as in the cutaneous,
the serous, &amp;c. in which it presides over nutrition
and exhalation; in the glandular, the mucous, &amp;c. in
which it produces secretion and nutrition, it is this which
is especially altered. From these derangements arise
alterations of texture, organic diseases properly called,
which are as common in these systems, as they are rare
in those in which the insensible contractility, is so very
obscure, as to be only at the degree necessary for nutrition.</p>

<p>It is to this that must be referred the infrequency of
acute inflammations of this system. As this affection is
frequent in the cutaneous, the serous, the mucous systems,
&amp;c. so this system, whose functions require but little insensible
organic contractility, presents it rarely. Those
who open many dead bodies know, that the texture of
the heart is hardly ever found inflamed. Nothing is
more common than phlegmasia of the external or serous
membrane, and of the internal or mucous membrane of
the stomach, the intestines, &amp;c.; but nothing is more obscure
and less frequently seen than that of their fleshy
tunic. In rheumatism, there is sometimes when the pains
cease around the joints, violent cholics, spasmodic vomitings
even, indices perhaps of an acute affection of the
fibres of the stomach or intestines; but we never find
marks of these affections; we do not see the muscular
texture exhibiting the bright red of the inflamed mucous,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
cutaneous and serous organs; or at least I have never
observed it.</p>

<p>Physicians have not paid sufficient attention to the difference
of inflammations according to the difference of
systems; but especially they have not sufficiently observed
that this difference accords perfectly with that of the
insensible organic contractility; that where this vital
force is most characterized, inflammations have the greatest
tendency to take place, because it is this which presides
over their formation; because these affections suppose
its increase; as convulsions suppose the increase of
animal contractility, as vomitings, accelerated pulsations
of the heart, suppose that of organic contractility, &amp;c. I
cannot repeat it too much, that the most frequent diseases
in each system, put always in action, raise or diminish
the predominant vital force in that system. It is a new
pathological view, that may be fruitful in results.</p>

<h3>ARTICLE FOURTH.<br />

<small>PHENOMENA OF THE ACTION OF THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM
OF ORGANIC LIFE.</small></h3>

<p>These phenomena are, as in the preceding system, relative
to the state of contraction or to that of relaxation.</p>


<h4>I. <i>Force of the Contractions.</i></h4>

<p>It is never capable of being raised to the point which
the force of the muscles of animal life sometimes attains.
Between the strongest and the weakest pulse, between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
the feeble jet which precedes some retentions of urine,
and the jet of the most vigorous man, there is much less
difference than between the langour of the voluntary
muscles of some women and the power of those of a
maniac, or a man in anger. The heart and the deltoid
muscle are nearly equal in respect to their fleshy mass;
now what would become of the circulation, if the first
sometimes sent the blood with the force which the second
uses to raise the superior extremity? A fit of anger,
mania, &amp;c. is sufficient to produce aneurisms. On the
other hand the organic muscles are not affected with those
prostrations of forces so common in the others; paralysis
is foreign to them, because they are not within the cerebral
influence. There is something which answers to convulsions;
it is the irregular agitations which produce so
many varieties in the pulse of acute fevers, agitations
which must be distinguished from those produced by an
organic defect of the heart; but these agitations are
wholly different from spasms of the voluntary muscles;
there is even no analogy.</p>

<p>There is not in the force of the contraction of the muscles
of which we are treating, the waste which is so remarkable
in that of the other muscles; the effort is nearly
proportionable to the acting cause, and the distinction of
this force into absolute and effective, cannot be applied
here; only there is required more or less contractile
energy, according as the body to be expelled from a hollow
muscle, is solid or fluid. Hence why the great intestines
are provided with longitudinal fibres more characterized
than those of the small intestines; why the rectum
especially, in which the excrements have their greatest
degree of solidity, exhibits these fibres in a more
evident manner than the colon or the cÃ¦cum, though
under a different form; why in diarrhÅ“as the weakest
contraction is sufficient to evacuate the intestines, whilst
the sensible organic contractility of the rectum being in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>sufficient
to void very solid excrements, it is necessary
that the abdominal muscle should aid the expulsion; why
when a hard body is introduced into the stomach, and the
gastric juices do not soften it, it remains there a long
time before being expelled, and produces an inconvenient
weight, &amp;c. &amp;c. We know with what rapidity the passage
of liquids takes place from the stomach to the intestines,
and how long on the contrary solid aliments remain
in the first.</p>

<p>The force of the organic muscles is incomparably
greater in the phenomena of life than in our experiments.
Once laid bare, the heart communicates only feeble motions,
and most often irregular ones. There is no proportion
between the force necessary to produce the jet, sometimes
from seven to eight feet, which the blood exhibits
coming from the open carotid of a dog, and the force of
the contractions which the strongest stimuli produce when
applied to the heart extracted from the body. Nothing
equals in our experiments the force of contraction necessary
for vomiting, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>Numerous calculations have been made upon the force
of contraction, in the organic muscles as in the preceding,
and there has been the same variety of results. Can we
in fact calculate the degrees of a phenomenon which
a thousand causes make vary every instant, not only in
different individuals, but even in the same, which sleep,
digestion, exercise, rest, tranquillity of mind, violence of
the passions, day, night, every thing in a word, incessantly
modifies? I do not know that we digest twice in exactly
the same period, if the urine twice remains the same
length of time in the bladder before being discharged, if
its jet is twice exactly equal, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The force of the organic muscles often remains in its
ordinary degree, or is even increased; whilst a general
weakness possesses the others. The force of the pulse,
vomiting, diarrhÅ“a, &amp;c. coinciding with a general pros<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>tration
of the muscles of animal life, are not rare phenomena
in diseases.</p>


<h4>II. <i>Quickness of the Contractions.</i></h4>

<p>It varies singularly; very rapid in experiments, when
death is recent and the stimuli are very strong, the contractions
are in general slower in the natural state; we
might say that it is in the inverse ratio of the force; often
at the instant we open the pericardium, the heart moves
with a rapidity which the eye can hardly follow, especially
if we inject an irritating fluid into this serous sac,
a little before laying the organ bare. The contractions
increase much in quickness in certain diseases; those of
the heart, for example, then acquire in the adult a rapidity
often much greater than they have in the first age; this
rapidity is also in this case entirely distinct from the force
of its contractions; it is rare even that these two things
are found united at the highest point. In general when
the force of the heart is increased, there is a little more
quickness; but there is very often a diminution of force
with an increase of quickness, or the force remains the
same, the quickness being much increased.</p>

<p>We have seen that the voluntary muscles have in general
a degree of quickness beyond which they cannot go,
and that this quickness belongs to the original constitution.
Is not the same phenomenon observed here? Often in
two fevers whose symptoms are the same, whose degree
of intensity seems to be exactly uniform, the pulse is infinitely
more frequent in one individual than in the other.
This does not always denote a difference in the disease,
but in the primitive constitution, an aptitude of one of
the two hearts to contract much quicker under the same
stimulant. Who does not know that in experiments, the
contractile rapidity is infinitely variable under the influence
of the same causes?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span></p>

<p>Each organic muscle has its degree of quickness; the
heart, the stomach, the intestines, the bladder, &amp;c. differ
remarkably in this respect.</p>


<h4>III. <i>Duration of the Contractions.</i></h4>

<p>The heart never remains in permanent contraction, as
often happens in the voluntary muscles. Though hunger
seems to prove the contrary in the stomach and the intestines,
yet this phenomenon is not contradictory; in fact,
the permanent contraction of the empty gastric viscera is
the result of the contractility of texture. Whenever the
sensible organic contractility is in action, there is alternate
contraction and dilatation; this alternation even characterizes
essentially this last property, and distinguishes
it from the animal contractility and from that of texture,
in which the state of contraction is often permanent.</p>


<h4>IV. <i>State of the Muscle in Contraction.</i></h4>

<p>All the phenomena described for the voluntary muscles,
are almost applicable to these, such as the hardening,
increase in thickness, diminution in length, expression of
the blood, &amp;c. &amp;c. But there are some differences between
the heart and the gastric muscles, in respect to the
mode of contraction. In fact we see very sensibly in the
first, 1st, contractions of the whole analogous to those of
the voluntary muscles, contractions which take place in
the state of health, which produce the projection of the
blood, and which are easily made in experiments when
the animals are still living; 2d, numerous oscillations
which seize upon the fibres, which agitate the whole of
them without producing any sensible effect, without contracting
the cavity, without projecting the blood for example.
These oscillations are observed at the instant of
death, when the heart is ceasing to be contractile; we
may then irritate it in vain, there are no more contrac<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>tions
of it as a whole; though there is a general and very
evident vibration of its fibres, yet its cavity is not contracted;
the blood stagnates in it. The heart perfectly
resembles under this double relation the voluntary muscles;
it is agitated as we see these muscles in the shuddering,
that is called horripilatio, as we see it also in certain
sub-cutaneous muscles in some individuals. I have
already, for example, seen many persons affected with an
habitual trembling of a portion of the solÃ¦us, a trembling
very evident to the eye through the skin, and which had
nothing in common with the contraction necessary to the
extension of the foot.</p>

<p>The involuntary muscles of the abdomen never exhibit
this double mode of contraction. Instead of the quick
and sudden motions of the whole of the muscle, we see
but a slow contraction in it, often but slightly apparent;
it is a kind of creeping; there is not even to speak properly
a contraction of the whole, like that of the heart
in which all the fibres of an auricle or ventricle are moved
at the same time; here each fleshy surface appears to act
successively. Placed at the origin of the great vessels,
the bladder and the stomach would be incapable of communicating
to the blood those motions by jerks, which
the jet of an artery exhibits at each contraction. On the
other hand, at the instant the motion ends in the stomach,
the intestines and the bladder, we never see in them
those oscillations, those vibrations which are almost constant
in the heart and the voluntary muscles, and which
we can even create in them at will.</p>


<h4>V. <i>Motions imparted by the Organic Muscles.</i></h4>

<p>There are hardly ever simple motions in these muscles;
the different interlacing of their fleshy surface allows them
to act almost always in three or four different directions
upon the substances they contain. We can say nothing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
general upon those motions which compose the diastole
of the heart, the peristaltic motion of the alimentary canal,
the contraction of the bladder, &amp;c. Each muscle has its
mechanism which belongs to the physiological history of
the function to which it contributes.</p>


<h4>VI. <i>Phenomena of the Relaxation of the Organic
Muscles.</i></h4>

<p>In the relaxation of the organic muscles, phenomena in
general take place that are opposite to the preceding. It
is then useless to enumerate them; but there is a question
here that should be examined, that of knowing the nature
of that state which succeeds contraction and alternates
with it.</p>

<p>In the muscles of animal life, when the contraction
ceases, the muscle does not in general go back itself to
the state it was in antecedent to the contraction, but it is
drawn back to it by its antagonist; for example, when
the biceps is contracted to bend the fore-arm and its contraction
ceases, it becomes passive; the triceps putting
itself then in motion, extends it and draws it back to its
natural position, by acting at first on the bones which
communicate the motion to this muscle. Each muscular
power of animal life finds then in that which is opposed
to it a cause of return to the state it had left in order to
contract. It is not so in organic life; its muscles, which
are all hollow, have no antagonists. We have considered
as such to a certain extent, the substances contained in
the hollow muscles, substances which oppose the effect of
contraction; but incapable most commonly of reacting
after having been compressed, on account of their want
of elasticity, these substances cannot perform the same
offices as real antagonists.</p>

<p>Most physiologists have admitted as a cause of dilatation,
the entrance of new substances, which replace, in
the muscular cavities, those expelled by contraction; thus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
the entrance of new blood into the heart, aliments into
the different portions of the alimentary canal, has been
considered as proper to dilate these organs; so that according
to this opinion the muscles would be purely
passive when they enlarged. But the following considerations,
many of which some authors, Grimaud in particular,
have already stated, do not permit us to consider in
this way the dilatation of the organic muscles, that of the
heart in particular.</p>

<p>1st. When we lay bare a hollow muscle, the heart, the
stomach, or the intestines, and empty it entirely of the substances
that it contains, it contracts and dilates alternately
as when it is full, if we apply an external stimulant to it.
2d. If we empty by punctures all the great vessels which
go to the heart, or come from it, so as to evacuate it entirely,
its alternate dilatations and contractions continue
for some time. 3d. In order to judge comparatively of
the degree of force of the contraction and the dilatation,
we can extract two hearts nearly equal in size from two
living animals; place immediately the fingers of one hand
into the auricles or the ventricles of the first, and grasp
with the other hand the exterior of the second; you will
feel that one makes as great an effort in dilating as the other
does in contracting. This fact already observed by Pechlin,
is so much the more remarkable, as the effort of dilatation
is often greater than that of contraction. I have
even observed, in repeating this experiment, that whatever
effort we make with the hand, we cannot prevent
the organ from dilating. 4th. The alternate extension and
contraction, from which arises the vermicular motion of
the intestines, is seen during hunger when we open the
abdomen of an animal. 5th. The hardness of the organic
muscular texture is as evident during dilatation as
during vacuity. 6th. I have many times observed that
at the instant in which I irritated the heart with the point
of a scalpel, that a dilatation was the first consequence of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
it, and that contraction was only consequent to it. It
happens in general more often that contraction begins the
motions in our experiments; but certainly, the muscle
being at rest, it is frequently a dilatation that first manifests
itself.</p>

<p>It appears then very probable that the dilatation of the
organic muscles is a phenomenon as vital as their contraction;
that these two states are united in a necessary
manner; that both of them compose muscular motion, of
which contraction is but one part. Who knows even if
each may not be disturbed separately, if to a regular contraction
may not succeed an irregular dilatation and vice
versa? Who knows if certain alterations in the pulse do
not belong to injuries of dilatation and others to those of
contraction? I am far from being certain; for in medicine
we must rest our belief on certainty and not on presumption;
but we can make this point an object of research.</p>

<p>It appears that sometimes the voluntary muscles are
also the seat of a true active dilatation. 1st. A muscle,
laid bare and extracted from the body, contracts and afterwards
dilates, without being drawn to this state of dilatation
by any cause. 2d. In an amputation, we often see
in the stump the end of the divided fibres alternately
lengthen and contract; a double motion both of which
appears to be equally vital. 3d. In many kinds of convulsions
in which the extremities stiffen, in those, for example,
which accompany most hysterical fits, it appears
that there is a very evident active dilatation; by placing
in fact the hand upon the muscles which should then be
relaxed, from the disposition of the parts, we perceive a
hardness as great as in feeling of the contracted muscles.</p>

<p>There are many researches to be made upon this mode
of dilatation of our parts, a mode which undoubtedly is
not exclusively confined to the muscular system, but
which appears to belong also to the iris, to the spongy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
texture of the corpora cavernosa, to the nipples, &amp;c. All
these organs move by dilating very evidently; contraction
succeeds in them expansion, as in the common muscles
relaxation does contraction. Expansion is the principal
phenomenon. Perhaps also, as some modern authors
have thought, the sudden swellings of the cellular texture,
which accompany contusions, bruises, &amp;c. are the result
of this mode of motion.</p>


<hr class="chap" />

<h3>ARTICLE FIFTH.<br />

<small>DEVELOPMENT OF THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM OF ORGANIC
LIFE.</small></h3>

<p>The organic muscular system is wholly the reverse of
the preceding, as it respects development. This is but
slightly characterized in the early ages, whereas the
growth of the other is precocious. Let us follow it in
all the ages.</p>


<h4>I. <i>State of the Organic Muscular System in the
FÅ“tus.</i></h4>

<p>In the first days after conception, the heart is formed;
it is the first point of motion, a punctum saliens, as it has
been called. The researches of different authors, of Haller
in particular, have rendered clear the successive progress
of its increase in the early periods. Rather late in their
formation, the muscles of the interior of the abdomen are
yet developed before those that form the parietes of this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
cavity. It is the size of the intestines, the stomach, the
bladder, &amp;c. almost as much as that of the liver, which
gives to the cavity in which these viscera are found, the
remarkable capacity that it then exhibits.</p>

<p>Nearly uniform at this age, as it respects the proportion
of their size, all the organic muscles are not as much
so in regard to that of their texture. The heart is
evidently firmer and more dense than all the others; its
texture is very distinct. The fibres of the stomach, intestines
and bladder are soft and loose and resemble exactly
those of the muscles of animal life; but little blood goes
to them in proportion to what they are afterwards to receive.
The fibres of the heart, on the contrary, dense
and compact, have a power of action in proportion to
what they are afterwards to have. Their redness is as
distinct; as much blood penetrates and consequently
nourishes them. This redness of the heart, analogous in
the adult to that of the voluntary muscles, forms at this
period a contrast with the remarkable paleness of these
muscles. Besides it has, as in all the other parts where
it exists, a deep tinge, owing to the kind of blood that
produces it.</p>

<p>We easily see the reason of the quantity of blood that
penetrates the heart, as this organ then very active in its
motions, has need of much force, whilst the others, almost
immoveable, require but little.</p>

<p>Yet the sensible organic contractility of the heart in the
fÅ“tus and in the first age has been exaggerated, undoubtedly
on account of the extreme rapidity that the circulation
then exhibits. This rapidity depends as much on
the activity of the tonic forces of the general capillary
system, as on that of the heart; for the blood, when it
has arrived in the capillary system, is wholly beyond the
influence of the heart, as we have seen; the stay that it
makes there is wholly dependant upon the forces of the
system itself; now these forces, at that time very active,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
accelerate the course of the blood, and send it into the
venous system, from which it goes to the heart. If the
excitability of this were double and even treble, and the
blood entered it but slowly, it would be unable to support
a rapid and at the same time continuous pulse. Haller
was drawn to this opinion by believing that the heart
was the only agent of impulse of the blood circulating
even in the small vessels. Besides, there is no doubt
that the sensible organic contractility of the heart is less
easily put into action by experiments in the fÅ“tus, and
that it is also much less durable. Then the strongest
stimuli have less effect upon it an instant after death, than
those of less power exhibit upon the heart of an animal
that has been born. I have many times established this
fact upon fÅ“tuses of guinea-pigs. Compared with that of
the voluntary muscles, the mobility of the heart is undoubtedly
remarkable in the fÅ“tus; but compared to what
it will be after birth, it is but slight.</p>

<p>It is precisely the same with the contractility of the
stomach, the bladder and the intestines; most commonly
we can produce no motion in these muscles by stimuli.
Mr. LÃ©veillÃ© has already made these important observations;
he has also remarked that the urine remained in
the bladder, and the meconium in the great intestines,
without producing a contraction sufficient to expel them.
I do not think however that there could be during life a
complete immobility of the gastric viscera, and for this reason;
most commonly the meconium is only met with in the
great intestines; it must have been formed in them then,
if there was complete immobility of the gastric muscles;
now it is much more probable that it is the residuum of the
bile, of all the mucous juices, &amp;c.; that consequently it
has been pushed successively by a slow action from the
superior part towards the inferior of the alimentary canal.</p>

<p>The softness of the organic muscles renders their extensibility
of texture very great at this period. I would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
observe however that the hearts of dead fÅ“tuses do not
exhibit those numberless varieties of size which those of
adults do in the right side, according to the different
kinds of death.</p>


<h4>II. <i>State of the Organic Muscular System during
Growth.</i></h4>

<p>The first days of existence are marked by an internal
motion as quick in manifesting itself as the external of
which we have spoken. The sucking of the milk, the
evacuation of the urine and meconium, &amp;c. are indices of
this general internal motion, of this agitation almost sudden
of all the involuntary muscles.</p>

<p>It is not the brain which, entering into action at birth,
produces the contraction of these muscles, since as we
have said they are not under its government; it appears
to depend, 1st, on the sympathetic influence exerted
upon their system, by the cutaneous organ, which is irritated
by the new medium; 2d, on the excitement made
upon the beginning of all the mucous surfaces, and upon
the whole of that of the lungs, an excitement which afterwards
reacts upon these muscles; 3d, on that produced
by fluids introduced into the stomach; 4th, on the sudden
entrance of the red blood into all these muscles, till
then penetrated like the others with black; this cause is
essential; irritability appears to be in part dependant on
it, or at least to borrow from it a remarkable increase of
force; 5th, the excretion of the meconium and the urine
is also powerfully assisted by the abdominal muscles,
which then enter into activity with the whole system to
which they belong.</p>

<p>The general internal motion which takes place in the
first moments of existence, and which is produced by the
suddenly increased activity of the involuntary muscles,
has an important use with respect to the mucous surfaces,
which it relieves of the fluids that load them, and whose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
presence becomes painful. Where the mucous surfaces
have not around them fleshy layers of the involuntary
muscles, as in the bronchia, the nasal fossÃ¦, &amp;c. the muscles
of animal life more or less distant, perform this function,
as for example, the diaphragm and the intercostals,
free the bronchial surface by coughing, and the pituitary
by sneezing.</p>

<p>As we recede from the period of birth, the organic
muscles grow in general much less in proportion than
the others; it is this that gradually re-establishes the equilibrium
between the two systems. I would remark however,
as it respects the predominance of the first, that it
is much less conspicuous in the fÅ“tus than that of the
nervous system. The brain, for example, is in proportion
much larger than the heart.</p>

<p>It is probable that the muscles of which we are treating,
exhibit, at this period, the same varieties of composition
as the others, that gelatine especially predominates in
them, that they have less fibrin, &amp;c. This last substance
perhaps exists, in the early periods, more abundantly in
the heart than in the other muscles of this class.</p>

<p>We have observed two very distinct periods in the
growth of the other muscles; one is finished when they
have acquired their length; the other, when their thickness
is complete. The first has not, in the organic system,
a term as distinct; when the stature no longer increases,
the gastric and urinary organs, and the heart still
lengthen and grow.</p>

<p>We have considered growth in too general a manner.
Each system has a different term in this great phenomenon.
The osseous and muscular systems of animal life,
and those which depend on them, as the fibrous, the cartilaginous,
&amp;c. have especially an influence upon the general
stature of the body; it is these which produce this
or that height; but this height has no influence upon the
length of the intestines, or the capacity of the stomach,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
the heart, the bladder, &amp;c. The glandular, serous, mucous
systems, &amp;c. are equally independent of stature; thus in
these numerous varieties, it has much more influence
upon the extremities, than upon the abdomen, the thorax,
&amp;c. A great height indicates the predominance of
the apparatus of locomotion, but not of those of digestion,
respiration, &amp;c. The termination of the growth in
height, which we consider in a general manner for the
whole body, is only the termination of the growth of the
muscles, the bones and their dependancies, and not of
that of the internal viscera, which still lengthen and become
thicker. It is easy to be convinced of this, by
comparing the organic muscles of a young man of eighteen
years, with those of a man of thirty or forty.</p>

<p>The organic muscles do not appear to be subject to
those irregularities of growth which the other muscles
and the bones frequently exhibit. We know that the
stature often remains stationary for many years, and that
suddenly it acquires very great dimensions in a very short
time; this phenomenon is remarkable especially after long
diseases. Now notwithstanding these inequalities, the
heart and all the other analogous muscles grow in an uniform
manner; the regularity of the internal functions to
which these muscles especially contribute, could not
adapt itself to those aberrations which would be unable to
disturb the functions of the locomotive organs. Besides,
if they took place, the circulation, digestion, excretion of
urine, &amp;c. would exhibit corresponding aberrations; now
this is never observed. The heart and the gastric muscles,
&amp;c. always grow in an infant whose stature remains
stationary; they do not grow suddenly in one who grows
at once; hence why the thorax and the abdomen become
large in the first case, and remain contracted in the second
in proportion to the extremities.</p>

<p>Besides these two systems are never in precise relation
of nutrition and power. I have already observed that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
very large organic muscles often exist with very small
voluntary ones, and vice versa.</p>

<p>Let us consider neither the growth nor nutrition in an
uniform manner; each system is developed and increases
in its own way; all are never found at the same periods of
this function. Why? because nutrition, like all the other
acts over which life presides, is essentially dependant on
the vital forces, and these forces vary in each system.</p>

<p>The growth of the involuntary muscular system is not
uniform in all the organs which compose it. Each increases
more or less, or is differently developed; one often
predominates over the others in an evident manner; a
bladder with strong, fleshy fibres, with columns as they
are called, is often found in a subject with a debilitated
stomach, with small intestines, &amp;c.; reciprocally, the
stomach, the heart, &amp;c. have often an insulated predominance.</p>


<h4>III. <i>State of the Organic Muscular System after
Growth.</i></h4>

<p>It is from the twenty-fourth to the twenty-sixth year,
that the organic muscles are completely developed. Then
the thorax and the abdomen which contain them have
their greatest capacity. These muscles are then as they
are to remain through life; they have a density much
greater than in youth; their power is increased and their
colour is deeper. In general this is subject in the heart
to frequent varieties, which coincide very nearly with
the varieties of the preceding system. Acute and chronic
diseases have nearly the same influence upon it. It is
equally the index of the sanguineous, lymphatic temperaments,
&amp;c. by the different tinge it assumes. The colour
of the gastric, intestinal and vesical fibres varies less;
their whiteness, more uniform, is rarely influenced by
diseases.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span></p>

<p>We cannot increase, by constant exercise, the nutrition
of the organic muscles. Aliments taken beyond measure,
making the stomach frequently contract, weaken it instead
of developing its fibres more, as happens from constant
exercise given to a superior or inferior extremity. The
bladder incessantly in action in some cases of incontinence,
is thus gradually weakened and loses its energy.
We might say that these two systems were in this respect
in an inverse order.</p>

<p>It appears that the nutrition of the organic muscles,
like that of the others, is subject to frequent variations;
that at some periods they are more developed and less so
at others. Diseases have a great influence upon this phenomenon,
which proves, like the softening of the bones
and their return to the natural state, the constant composition
and decomposition of which these organs are the
seat. We find in the dissecting rooms many differences
in different subjects, as it respects the colour, density and
cohesion of the muscles. Now what many exhibit then
at once, the same individual often experiences successively;
the same man no doubt has, according to the different
influences to which he is exposed, his heart red,
dense, large and well nourished at one period of life, and
feeble, pale and small at another; for the internal organs
experience the same alterations as the exterior. Now we
know that the external appearance often changes during
life.</p>


<h4>IV. <i>State of the Organic Muscular System in Old
Age.</i></h4>

<p>As we advance in age, the muscular system of which
we are treating becomes weak like all the others; yet its
action is more durable; it survives, if we may so say,
that of the other. When the old man, almost immoveable,
crawls about but slowly and with pain, his pulse,
digestion, &amp;c. have vigour still. This difference of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
two systems is so much the more remarkable, as the time
of activity of the second is almost by half less than that
of the first; sleep cuts off in fact almost half of the duration
of the voluntary motions, whilst it leaves the involuntary
wholly untouched. This phenomenon of the
organic muscles as it were surviving the voluntary in the
last periods of life, is derived on a great scale from the
same principle from which arises on a small one the lassitude
which follows the contraction in an insulated motion.
A less durable motion is necessary to fatigue the voluntary
muscles, than to fatigue the involuntary; the stomach
empty remains for a long time contracted upon itself without
producing any painful sensation, whilst if we hold a
body strongly grasped between our fingers for a quarter
of an hour, all the flexors are soon painfully affected.
After a convulsion of half an hour, in which all the locomotive
muscles have been stiff, the whole body is broken,
as it is called; it cannot admit of any motion; whilst
after a paroxysm of fever of six or eight hours in which
the pulse has been violently agitated, the heart often preserves
the natural type of its contractions; it requires
repeated paroxysms to weaken it. All these phenomena
of the two muscular systems evidently prove that that of
animal life is fatigued much the soonest; it is this which
occasions its intermission. Is it then astonishing that,
although less often in exercise than the other, it exhausts
sooner the quantum of force nature has given to it? is it
astonishing that the other survives the longest? Life is
a great exercise which gradually wears up the organs in
motion, and which requires their rest; this rest is death;
now each moveable organ arrives at it sooner or later,
according to the different degree of the forces which it
has to expend, and according to its greater or less disposition
to be wearied by this great exercise.</p>

<p>Yet the organic muscles are gradually weakened. The
pulse becomes slower, digestion is longer in old age; the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
bladder and rectum first cease to act; then the intestines
remain inactive; the stomach and especially the heart die
the last.</p>

<p>A long time before death, the muscular cohesion is
weakened in this system as in the preceding; the fleshy
texture becomes flaccid; the parietes of the heart support
themselves in youth; they flatten in old age. The gastric
system of a young animal suddenly killed during
hunger is firm, dense and contracted upon itself; in an
old one, under the same circumstance, it is but little
contracted; the stomach and intestines remain much more
dilated; they are loose and soft; it is the same phenomenon
as in the preceding muscles, which vacillate under
the skin, from want of cohesion. The bladder remains
constantly large, though empty.</p>

<h2><a name="MUCOUS_SYSTEM" id="MUCOUS_SYSTEM">MUCOUS SYSTEM.</a></h2>


<p>This system, the name of which I borrow from the
fluid that constantly lubricates it, and which is furnished
by small glands inherent in its structure, appears everywhere
in a membranous form; that of fasciculi is wholly
foreign to it. In speaking of the mucous organs we shall
designate them almost always under the name of membranes.
Their study is a new object of research. Pinel
has been among the first, who has perceived the necessity
of considering them in a general manner as it respects
diseases. I believe that I am the first who has regarded
them generally in an anatomical and physiological view.
Few systems deserve more attention; upon it take place
all the great phenomena of digestion, respiration, secretion,
excretion, &amp;c.; it is the seat of many diseases. It should
alone, in a nosography in which diseases are distributed
by systems, occupy a place equal to that of many.</p>


<hr class="chap" />

<h3>ARTICLE FIRST.<br />

<small>OF THE DIVISIONS AND FORMS OF THE MUCOUS SYSTEM.</small></h3>

<p>The mucous membranes occupy the interior of the
cavities which communicate with the skin by the different
openings this covering has on the surface of the body.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
Their number at first view is very considerable; for the
organs in which they are reflected are very numerous.
The mouth, the stomach, the intestines, the Å“sophagus,
the bladder, the urethra, the womb, the ureters, all the
excretories, &amp;c. &amp;c. derive from these membranes a part
of their structure. Yet if we consider that wherever they
are continuous, wherever we see them originate, by extending
from each other, as they originated in the first
instance from the skin, we shall perceive that this number
must be wonderfully limited. In fact by thus describing
them, not separately in each part, but at the same time in
all those upon which they are continued, we see that they
are reduced to two general surfaces, of which all the
others are portions, and which, on account of the different
parts to which they are distributed, can be called, the
one gastro-pulmonary, the other genito-urinary. The
first is found in the head, the neck and the abdomen.
This last cavity and more especially the pelvis, contain the
second.</p>

<p>There is also a small insulated mucous surface; it is that
which enters by the openings of the nipples and lines the
lactiferous tubes. But it is so small that it deserves but
little attention; besides, what will be said of the two
others will be equally applicable to it. It is then useless
to examine it in a general manner.</p>


<h4>I. <i>Of the two General Mucous Membranes, the Gastro-Pulmonary
and the Genito-Urinary.</i></h4>

<p>The gastro-pulmonary surface penetrates into the interior
by the mouth, the nose and the anterior face of the
eye. 1st. It lines the first and second of these cavities,
extends from the first to the excretory ducts of the parotid
and sub-maxillary glands, from the other into all the
sinuses, forms the conjunctiva, dips down into the puncta
lachrymalia, the nasal duct, the sac of the same name,
and is continued into the nose; 2d, it descends into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
pharynx, furnishes an elongation to the Eustachian tube,
then penetrates the internal ear and lines it, as we shall
see; 3d, it dips down into the trachea and is spread upon
all the air-tubes; 4th, it penetrates into the Å“sophagus
and the stomach; 5th, it extends to the duodenum where
it furnishes two elongations, one destined to the ductus
choledochus, to the numerous branches of the hepatic and
cystic ducts and the gall-bladder, the other to the pancreatic
duct and its different branches; 6th, it is continued
into the small and large intestines and finally terminates
at the anus where we see it identified with the skin.</p>

<p>The second general mucous membrane, which we have
called the genito-urinary, enters in man by the urethra,
and thence is spread on the one hand upon the bladder,
the ureters, the pelvis of the kidnies, the infundibula, the
papillÃ¦ and the capillary tubes which open on their summit;
on the other hand it goes into the excretory tubes of
the prostate, into the seminal ducts, the vesiculÃ¦ seminales,
the vasa deferentia and the branches with numberless
windings that produce them.</p>

<p>In woman, this membrane is introduced by the os externum
and penetrating on the one hand by the urethra,
goes as in man upon the urinary organs; on the other hand,
we see it enter the vagina, lining it, the uterus and the
fallopian tubes, and afterwards becoming continuous with
the peritoneum by the opening of these tubes. It is the
only example in the economy, of a communication established
between the mucous and serous surfaces.</p>

<p>This manner of describing the course of the mucous
surfaces, by saying that they are elongated, dip down,
penetrate, &amp;c. from one cavity to another, is no doubt
not conformable to the progress of nature, which creates
in each organ the membranes belonging to this organ, and
does not thus extend them by degrees; but our manner
of understanding it is better adapted to this language,
the meaning of which the least reflection will show.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span></p>

<p>In thus referring to two general membranes all the
mucous surfaces, I am not only supported by anatomical
inspection, but pathological observation has also furnished
me with points of demarcation between the two, and
points of contact between the different portions of membranes
of which each is the assemblage. In the different
descriptions of catarrhal epidemics given by authors, we
frequently see one of these membranes affected in all
parts, the other remaining sound; it is especially not rare
to observe a general affection of the first, of that which
extends from the mouth, the nose, the surface of the eye,
into the alimentary canal and the bronchial vessels. The
last epidemic observed at Paris, with which Pinal himself
was affected, was of this character; that of 1761, described
by Razou, had it also; that of 1752, described in the memoirs
of the Society of Edinburgh was remarkable for a
similar phenomenon; now, we do not see at that time a
corresponding affection in the mucous membrane that is
spread upon the urinary organs and upon those of generation.
There is then here, 1st, an analogy between the
portions of the first, by the uniformity of affection; 2d,
a demarcation between the two by the health of the one
and the disease of the other.</p>

<p>We see also that the irritation of any one point of one
of these membranes, frequently produces a pain in another
point of the same membrane, which is not irritated.
Thus a calculus in the bladder occasions a pain at the end
of the glans penis, the presence of worms in the intestines
causes an itching of the nose, &amp;c. &amp;c. Now, in
these phenomena purely sympathetic, it is very rare that
the partial irritation of one of these two membranes
affects with pain one of the parts of the other; there are
however examples of it; such is the singular relation
that exists, in mucous hemorrhages, between the membrane
of the womb and that of the bronchia. If the
blood ceases accidentally to flow from one during menstru<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>ation,
the other frequently exhales it and thus as it were
supplies its functions.</p>

<p>We ought then, from inspection and observation, to
consider the mucous surface, in general, as formed by two
great membranes successively spread upon many organs,
having between them no communication except by the
skin, which serves them as an intermediate organ, and
which, continuing with both, contributes thus with them
to form a general membrane everywhere, continuous,
covering the animal externally, and extending within
upon most of its essential parts. We can conceive that
there should exist important relations between the internal
and external portion of this single membrane; and
that they do will be proved by further researches.</p>


<h4>II. <i>Adhering Surface of the Mucous Membranes.</i></h4>

<p>Every mucous membrane exhibits two surfaces, one
adhering to the neighbouring organs, the other free,
covered with villi, always moistened with a mucous fluid.
Each deserves particular attention.</p>

<p>The adhering surface corresponds almost everywhere
with the muscles, either of animal or organic life. The
mouth, the pharynx, the whole alimentary canal, the
bladder, the vagina, the womb, a portion of the urethra,
&amp;c. exhibit a muscular layer embracing on the outside
their mucous tunic which is within. This arrangement
coincides perfectly, in animals with a fleshy membrane,
with that of the skin, which moreover approximates very
near, as we shall see, the structure of the mucous membranes,
and which, as we have seen, is everywhere continuous
with them. This arrangement of the mucous
membranes occasions them to be agitated by constant
motions which favour wonderfully the secretion that
takes place in them, the excretion which succeeds it, and
the various other functions of which they are the seat. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
insertion of this muscular layer exterior to the mucous
system, is made, as we have seen, by this dense and compact
texture which I have called the sub-mucous. It is
from this texture, more compact than the rest of the cellular
system, that the mucous surface derives its force. It
is from it that the organ which it lines receives its form;
it is this which supports and preserves this form; the
following experiment proves it. Take a portion of the
intestine; remove from any part of it this layer, as well
as the serous and the muscular; then inflate it, after having
tied it below; the air produces in this place a hernia
of the mucous coat. Try afterwards another portion of
intestine; deprive this, for a small space, of its mucous
membrane and of this also; inflation will produce upon
the serous and muscular tunics the same phenomenon
that it did in the preceding on the mucous; then it is to
this sub-mucous cellular layer that it owes the resistance
with which it opposes substances that it contains. The
same may be said of the stomach, the bladder, the Å“sophagus,
&amp;c.</p>


<h4>III. <i>Free Surface of the Mucous Membranes.</i></h4>

<p>The free surface of the mucous membranes, that which
is continually moistened by the fluid from which they
borrow their name, exhibits three species of wrinkles or
folds.</p>

<p>1st. One inherent in the structure of all the laminÃ¦ of
these membranes, is constantly met with, whatever may
be their state of dilatation or contraction; such are those
of the pylorus and the valve of Bauhin. These folds are
formed not only by the mucous membrane, but also by
the intermediate tunic of which we have spoken, which
here has a remarkable density and thickness, and gives
them solidity. The fleshy tunic enters even into their
composition, and we see on the exterior, upon the serous
surface, a depression that indicates their presence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span></p>

<p>2d. Other folds, only formed by the mucous surface, exist
also always in a state of vacuity or fulness, less evident
however than this; they are owing to the circumstance
that the mucous surface is much more extensive than those
upon which it is applied, so that it is folded that it may
not run a longer course; such are the valvulÃ¦ conniventes
of the small intestines, the structure of which we see very
well by cutting longitudinally one of these intestines.
The edge of the section exhibits the fleshy layer and the
serous surface in a straight direction, whilst the mucous
layer describes a line resembling a loose thread.</p>

<p>3d. The last species of folds is as it were accidental,
and is only observed during the contraction of the organ
which is lined by the mucous surface that is the seat of
it; such are those of the interior of the stomach, the
great intestines, &amp;c. In the greatest number of subjects
brought to the dissecting rooms, these folds of which so
much has been said as it respects the stomach, cannot be
perceived in it, because the subject has died after a disease
that has so altered the vital forces, as to prevent all
action of this viscus; so that though it is frequently found
empty, its fibres are not contracted. In experiments
upon living animals, on the contrary, these folds become
very evident, and may be demonstrated in this way;
make a dog eat or drink copiously, open him an instant
after and cut the stomach in the length of its great curvature;
no fold is then apparent; but soon the viscus contracts,
its edges are turned over and the aliments escape;
the whole mucous surface is covered with an infinite
number of very prominent ridges, which have as it were
the form of cerebral circumvolutions. We obtain the
same result by taking out the stomach of an animal
recently killed, distending it with air and opening it
afterwards, or by cutting it immediately in its state of
vacuity and drawing it in opposite directions by its edges;
it stretches, its ridges disappear, and if we cease to dis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>tend
it, they form again immediately in an evident manner.
I would observe on the subject of the inflation
of the stomach, that by distending it with oxygen, we
do not produce by the contact of this gas, greater ridges
and consequently a stronger contraction, than by using
for the same purpose carbonic acid gas. This experiment
furnishes a result very similar to what I have observed in
rendering animals emphysematous by different aeriform
fluids. It follows from all that we have said upon the
folds of the mucous membranes, that in the ordinary contraction
of the hollow organs which these membranes line
they undergo but a very slight diminution of surface, that
they contract scarcely at all, but fold within, so that by
dissecting them on an organ in contraction we should
have a surface almost equal in extent to that which they
exhibit during its dilatation. This assertion, which is
true as it respects the stomach, the Å“sophagus and the
great intestines, is not perhaps as entirely so with regard
to the bladder, the contraction of which makes the ridges
within less evident; but they are not sufficient to destroy
the general law. It is also nearly the same with the gall-bladder;
yet here we find another cause. The gall-bladder,
alternately observed in hunger and during digestion, contains
double the bile in the first case that it does in the
second, as I have had occasion to see very often indeed,
in experiments made for this object or with other views.
Now, when the bladder is in part empty, it does not contract
upon the bile that remains, with the force of the
stomach when it contains but few aliments, or with the
power of the bladder when it contains but little urine. It
is then flaccid; so that its being distended or not has but
a slight influence upon the folds of its mucous membrane.</p>

<p>Besides, in saying that the mucous membranes always
exhibit, with some slight difference, the same surface in
the extension and contraction of their respective organs,
I intend to speak only of the ordinary state of the func<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>tions,
and not of those enormous dilatations of which we
often see the stomach, the bladder, and more rarely the
intestines become the seat. Then there is no doubt, a
real extension and contraction, which coincide in the
membrane with those of the organ.</p>

<p>A remarkable observation which the free surface of the
mucous membranes exhibits, and which I have already
pointed out, is, that this surface is everywhere in contact
with bodies heterogenous to that of the animal, whether
these bodies introduced from without to nourish it have
not yet been assimilated to its substance, as we see in the
alimentary canal and in the wind-pipe; or whether they
come from within, as we observe in all the excretory
ducts of the glands, which all open into cavities lined by
the mucous membranes, and transmit without particles
which, after having contributed for some time to the composition
of the solids, become heterogeneous to them,
and are separated from them by the constant motion of
decomposition which takes place in living bodies. Hence
we ought to regard the mucous membranes as limits, and
barriers, which, placed between our organs and the bodies
that are foreign to them, defend them from the mischievous
impression of these bodies, and serve consequently
within, the same functions which the skin performs
without, with respect to the bodies which surround
that of the animal, and which tend incessantly to act
upon it.</p>

<p>The organization of the mucous system and its vital
properties are accommodated to this habitual contact of
substances heterogeneous to the living economy. That
which is a foreign body to the other systems, the cellular,
the muscular, &amp;c. is not so to this. Solid substances, the
metals, stones, wood, &amp;c. which introduced into our parts
excite in them inevitably suppuration and an antecedent
inflammation by their simple contact, pass with impunity
over this, provided that their angles and asperities do not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
tear it; they only augment a little the secretion, as I
shall say. We can swallow a ball of lead, of wood, &amp;c. and
pass it by the anus without inconvenience. All the irritating
fluids without being caustic, that we inject into the
great intestines in enemas, or that we swallow, would
produce abscesses, &amp;c. if they were forced into the cellular
system, &amp;c. Surgeons employ the term foreign bodies
in too general a manner; that which is so for one system,
is not for another. Foreign is, in this respect, a term of
comparison which we should employ only after a knowledge
of the peculiar sensibility of each system, and not
after that of this property described in a vague manner.</p>

<p>The mucous system not only bears without danger the
presence of all bodies that are introduced into the economy,
but also when it goes out, it can be exposed with
impunity to the contact of external stimuli. Observe
what takes place in prolapsus of the womb in which the
whole membrane of the vagina sometimes becomes external,
in those inversions of the intestinal tubes that take
place through preternatural ani, in prolapsus of the rectum,
&amp;c.; then the mucous surfaces serve really as integuments;
now in these cases the surrounding bodies produce
hardly any more pain on them than upon the skin.
On the contrary, the instant a serous surface is laid bare,
as for example in the operation of hernia, in which
the intestine is suffered to come out, on account of an
opening unfortunately made by the point of a bistoury,
this surface inevitably inflames. All the cellular, muscular,
nervous, glandular systems, &amp;c. laid bare, exhibit
the same phenomenon. There is no danger in opening
the bladder as it respects the contact of the air, whilst
there is much in permitting this fluid to penetrate into an
articular cavity, a tendinous groove, a serous sac, &amp;c.
We know how much in the high operation for the stone,
we fear to wound the peritoneum, how uncertain are the
results of empyema on account of the contact of the air<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
upon the pleura, &amp;c. The dangers of the action of this
fluid upon these surfaces have been perhaps exaggerated,
but they are notwithstanding real.</p>

<p>If a fistula extends from the exterior of the abdomen
into the intestines, its whole course is lined with callous
bodies; these defend the cellular texture and the muscles
through which the fistula passes. On the contrary,
nothing similar appears upon the intestinal mucous surface,
because its organization alone is sufficient to protect
it. The urinary, salivary and lacrymal fluids never
escape externally by artificial ducts formed in the neighbouring
organs, without there are similar callous bodies
in the course of these ducts; on the contrary, they pass
with impunity over the mucous surfaces. Make in a limb a
long and straight opening with a pointed instrument, and
fix in it for a time a sound; a callous canal will be produced
by it. Let a sound on the contrary remain in the
urethra, no alteration of texture will result from it.</p>

<p>Let us conclude from these different considerations,
that the mucous system with the cutaneous alone, is
organized so as to support the contact of all external
bodies, and not to be affected by their presence, or at
least experience only an increase of secretion, which is in
no ways dangerous. Thus these two systems form two
boundaries, the one internal and the other external, between
which are placed the organs foreign, by their
mode of sensibility and by that of their structure, to
the external bodies. To these boundaries the excitement
of these bodies is limited; their influence does not go
beyond. So long as they do not pass these boundaries,
the other organs do not feel them. We might say that
the acute sensibility which each of them enjoys, is a kind
of sentinel that nature has placed on the confines of the
organic domain of the mind, to inform it of whatever can
injure it.</p>

<h3>ARTICLE SECOND.<br />

<small>ORGANIZATION OF THE MUCOUS SYSTEM.</small></h3>


<h4>I. <i>Texture Peculiar to this Organization.</i></h4>

<p>The mucous system presents two things to be considered
in its peculiar texture, viz. 1st, a layer more or less
thick which constitutes principally this texture, and which
by analogy with the cutaneous corion, may be called
the mucous corion; 2d, many small elongations which
surmount it, and which are called villi or papillÃ¦. As to
the epidermis which covers it, I shall treat of it with the
cutaneous epidermis. This texture has nothing similar
to the substance that colours the skin, and which is between
the papillÃ¦ and epidermis. We know in fact that
negroes, as well as whites, have this texture of a bright
red, which it derives from its vessels.</p>


<h5><i>Mucous Corion.</i></h5>

<p>This portion of the mucous texture, which is the most
important, and which constitutes the thickness, form, and
even the nature of it, has a soft and spongy appearance.
We might say at first view that it was a consistent pulp,
with which the extremely dense cellular texture that is
subjacent to it had been covered. This softness is a
character which distinguishes it from the cutaneous corion,
which moreover has by its intimate nature but little resemblance
to it.</p>

<p>The mucous corion is very various as to thickness; it
differs in this respect in each organ. That of the gums
and the palate is the thickest of all. Then come those of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
the nasal fossÃ¦ and the stomach, then those of the small
intestines and the gall-bladder, then those of the large
intestines, of the urinary bladder, the urethra and the
other excretories, until it begins at length to become so
fine as to appear transparent like a serous surface when it
is removed with care. Finally, the finest and most delicate
is that of the sinuses of the face and the interior of
the ear; the arachnoides is often coarser.</p>

<p>I have called the texture within the ear mucous, though
all anatomists call the membrane of the cavities of this
organ periosteum. In fact, 1st, we see it evidently continued
with the pituitary membrane, by means of the
elongation of the Eustachian tube. 2d. We find it constantly
moistened by a mucous fluid which this canal
serves to convey out, a character foreign to the periosteum,
which, like the fibrous membranes, always adheres
by both its surfaces. 3d. No fibre can be distinguished in
it. 4th. Its fungous appearance, though white and soft,
and the ease with which it is torn, are evident attributes
of the mucous membranes. Every thing proves that the
membrane of the tympanum, that of the meatus, &amp;c. belong
to the system of which we are treating. Thus in
catarrhs of the pituitary membrane, and of that of the
fauces, we most often find that the ear is affected; thus
the ear is, like the mucous surfaces, the seat of hemorrhage,
thus polypi arise in it, as in the nose and on the
surface of the womb. We consider as a sign of deposition
of pus in the ear, every purulent discharge coming
from that cavity. But how can we conceive of a purulent
collection in a part in which there is hardly any
cellular texture, in a part wholly osseous? Besides the
fibrous system, to which the periosteum of the tympanum
belongs, hardly ever suppurates, as we know. Every
thing then induces us to believe that these discharges are
only the effect of a catarrh of the ear, a catarrh which is
sometimes acute and sometimes chronic. I have more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>over
a recent and decisive fact upon this point; the body
of a man subject to these discharges during life exhibited
a remarkable thickness and redness of the membrane of
the tympanum, but without the least trace of erosion.
The ear suppurates like the urethra, the vagina, &amp;c. it is
not a new fluid which is formed by suppuration; it is
that which naturally comes from the meatus which increases
in quantity and comes through a preternatural
opening of the membrane of the tympanum.</p>

<p>Diseases make the thickness of all the mucous surfaces
vary remarkably. I have seen them many lines thick in
the maxillary sinus, and nearly half an inch in the bladder.
In great extensions of the mucous sacs, this thickness
diminishes very much; it increases in their contractions.
The stomach especially exhibits this phenomenon
in these two opposite states.</p>

<p>The softness of the mucous corion is also very variable;
in the nasal fossÃ¦, in the stomach and the intestines, it is
really a kind of organized velvet. The name of villous
membrane is perfectly suited to it. On the contrary, at the
origins of the mucous system, as in the mouth, upon the
glans penis, at the entrance of the nose, it is a more dense
and compact texture, approximating nearer in its nature
to the cutaneous corion. I am persuaded that like this it
might be tanned and be useful in the arts if it were in
larger pieces, whilst I doubt if the action of tanning
could produce an analogous phenomenon upon the mucous
texture of the deep-seated organs. The softness of
this would render it incapable of serving for external integuments.
The least cause would be in fact sufficient to
break and tear it. Its structure being different from
that of the cutaneous corion is the reason that the variolus
pustules never appear on it, whilst we often see them
on the mucous surfaces near the openings of the skin,
especially upon the tongue, the palate and the internal
surface of the cheeks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span></p>

<p>Exposed to the action of dry air, so that it may come
everywhere in contact with it, it becomes dry and very
thin, but preserves some resistance. In bladders inflated
and dried, in the stomach, the intestines, &amp;c. thus prepared,
it is this texture which supports these organs, and
which prevents them from becoming flat, though we permit
the air to escape; it offers even a resistance, from
which arises a kind of crepitation when we wish to bend
them in various directions. To be convinced of this, it
is only necessary to dry the mucous surface separate from
the serous and muscular that correspond with it; these
when dried remain pliable like the cellular texture, whilst
the first has a kind of rigidity.</p>

<p>In the organs in which the redness of the mucous texture
is slight, as in the bladder, the rectum, &amp;c. it becomes
transparent by drying. Where it is very red as
in the stomach, it takes a deep tinge, which becomes even
almost black if there had been an antecedent inflammation
in it by which much blood had been accumulated;
hence it appears that this fluid is the cause of the colour.</p>

<p>Thus dried the mucous surfaces are smooth; they lose
their viscidity at least in appearance; their folds are
effaced by adhering to the surface from which they arise;
thus the valvulÃ¦ conniventes are marked in a dried intestine,
only by a red line, without any apparent prominence.
But if we macerate the intestines in this state,
the folds form again and become visible.</p>

<p>Exposed to a moist air, or left with other flesh that will
not allow it to become dry, the mucous corion putrefies
with great ease; the odour that it then sends out is very
fetid. I think the reason why the abdomen of dead bodies
becomes putrid so soon is in part because it contains substances
already in putrefaction, and also because the surfaces,
in contact with these substances, and which by their
vitality resisted before their action, then readily yield to
them. If these substances were contiguous to aponeu<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>roses,
putrefaction would be much less rapid. The
mucous system when putrid takes a greyish colour; and
as the dense, subjacent cellular texture putrefies much
less easily, we can then remove from it by the least pressure,
the mucous corion, reduced to a putrid pulp, in
which every trace of organization has disappeared, and
which forms a real pap.</p>

<p>During life, gangrene of the mucous texture takes place
in general less frequently than that of the cutaneous.
The consequences of catarrh, compared with those of
erysipelas may convince us of this; there are however
cases in which death appears in this texture, whilst the
surrounding ones continue to live, as in gangrenous
angina.</p>

<p>Exposed to maceration, the mucous texture yields to it
promptly. I think that next to the brain it is altered
quickest by the action of water. It is then reduced to
a reddish pulp very different from that from putrefaction
in the open air. When we put the whole stomach to
macerate, this pulp is detached, when the sub-mucous
texture and the serous membrane have as yet undergone
but little alteration.</p>

<p>Ebullition at first extracts from the mucous texture a
greenish scum, very different from that which the muscular
and cellular textures give when boiled. This scum
which mixed with the whole fluid in the beginning of
the boiling, disturbs it and renders it green at first, afterwards
rises upon the surface where it has small bubbles
of air mixed with its substance; it often even falls to the
bottom of the vessel by its weight. Sulphuric acid changes
the colour of it to a dull brown.</p>

<p>A short time before the water begins to boil, the mucous
texture crisps and acquires the horny hardness like
the others, but in a less degree however; hence why it
is then wrinkled almost always in different directions. In
fact, the sub-mucous texture upon which it is applied,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
contracting at that time much more than it, it must fold
on account of its length; thus during life, when the
fleshy coat of the stomach contracts, its mucous surface
not contracting in proportion, produces the numerous
folds of which we have spoken. The action of a concentrated
acid crisping the sub-mucous texture more than
the mucous itself, produces an analogous phenomenon.
After having been a long time dried, the mucous texture,
like however almost all those of the animal economy, does
not lose the faculty of acquiring the horny hardness when
it is plunged into boiling water; it exhibits this phenomenon,
whether we expose it to it dry, or whether we do
it after having first softened it in cold water. It is a
means by which all the valvulÃ¦ conniventes may be made
suddenly to reappear, which had disappeared by drying,
and which form again the instant the intestine contracts.
This experiment is very curious to witness.</p>

<p>When the ebullition has been a long time continued, the
mucous texture turns gradually to a very deep grey, from
the white which it had first become. It is not softer than
in the natural state, but it breaks much quicker; the following
experiment is a proof of it. If we draw the mucous
corion, boiled for some time with the subjacent cellular
texture, this last resists the most; so that it remains
entire, whilst the mucous corion is broken in many places.
This never assumes the gelatinous appearance of the cutaneous
corion or the fibrous and cartilaginous organs when
boiled and of the others which yield much gelatine.
However by mixing a solution of tannin with the water
in which this system taken from an adult has been boiled,
I have seen an evident precipitate.</p>

<p>The action of the acids reduces to a pulp the mucous
texture much sooner than most of the others. During
life, all the caustics act much more rapidly upon it than
upon the cutaneous, of which the thick epidermis is an
intermediate organ which checks their tendency of com<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>bining
with its corion. Thus the instant the nitric acid,
a substance which common people almost always choose
for their poison, as the practice at the HÃ´tel Dieu proves,
thus the instant I say, that the nitric acid is in contact
with the alimentary canal, it disorganizes it, it forms
there a whitish eschar, which, when death does not take
place immediately, as most often happens, is slowly removed
and detached in the form of a membrane. We
know that the lips gently rubbed with weakened nitric
acid, become the seat of a troublesome itching, whilst that
oftentimes though this acid may have acted upon the skin
sufficiently to make it yellow, it does not suffer from it.</p>

<p>The softness of the mucous corion makes me presume
that it is easily altered by the digestive juices, not that I
confide in the experiments of Hunter, who pretended
that these juices could act upon the coat that secretes
them, but because in general I have observed that the
textures like it yield very easily to the action of water
in maceration and are also very easily digested. I have
not however any experiment upon the subject, and we
know that in the animal economy analogy is not always
a faithful guide.</p>

<p>All the mucous surfaces, but especially that of the
stomach and intestines, have the property of curdling
milk, as have many other substances, especially the acids.
Is it to this property that must be attributed a phenomenon
which is constant during life, viz. the coagulation of
milk that enters the stomach for digestion? or is this
phenomenon owing to the mixture of this fluid with
those which are secreted by the surface of this organ? I
think that both these causes contribute to it at the same
time; both separate produce in fact this phenomenon.
Spallanzani has proved it as it respects the gastric juices.
Every body knows that the mucous membrane dried, and
consequently deprived of these juices, preserves the property
of coagulating milk. Spallanzani has convinced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
himself that the serous and organic muscular systems of
the stomach are destitute of it.</p>

<p>Are aphthÃ¦ an affection of the mucous corion? do they
belong to the papillÃ¦? are they seated in the glands? are
they a separate inflammation of these glands, whilst catarrhs
are characterized by a general inflammation of a considerable
extent of the mucous system? All these questions
deserve to be examined. Pinel has perceived the
void there is in morbid anatomy upon this point.</p>


<h5><i>Mucous PapillÃ¦.</i></h5>

<p>The peculiar kind of sensibility which the skin enjoys
is attributed principally, as we know, to what is called
the papillary body, which commonly is not easy to be
demonstrated. The sensibility of the mucous membranes,
somewhat analogous to that of the skin, appears to me to
have the same kind of organization, which is perceived
with infinitely less ease. The papillÃ¦ of this system cannot
be called in question at its origin, where it dips into
the cavities, in the commencement even of these cavities,
as upon the tongue, the palate, the internal part of the
alÃ¦ of the nose, upon the glans penis, in the fossa navicularis,
within the lips, &amp;c. Inspection is sufficient to
demonstrate them there. But it is asked if the papillÃ¦
exist also in the deep-seated parts of this system. Analogy
indicates it, since the sensibility is as great there as at
their origin, though with varieties that we shall point
out; but inspection proves it in a manner not less certain.
I think that the villi with which we everywhere
see them covered are nothing but these papillÃ¦.</p>

<p>Very different ideas have been entertained of the nature
of these villi; they have been considered in the stomach
and the Å“sophagus as destined to the exhalation of the
gastric juice, in the intestines as serving for the absorption
of chyle, &amp;c. But, 1st, it is difficult to conceive
how an organ everywhere nearly similar, can perform in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
different parts functions so different; I say nearly similar,
for we shall see that these papillÃ¦ exhibit differences of
length, size, &amp;c. without having any of texture or structure.
2d. What can be the functions of the villi of the
pituitary membrane, of the internal coat of the urethra,
the bladder, &amp;c. if they have not relation to the sensibility
of these membranes? 3d. The microscopical experiments
of Leiberkuhn upon the vesicle of the intestinal
villi have been contradicted by those of Hunter, of Cruikshank
and especially of Hewson. I am certain that I
have never seen any thing similar on the surface of the
small intestines, at the time of chylous absorption; and
yet it would appear that a thing of inspection could not
vary. 4th. It is true that these intestinal villi are everywhere
accompanied by a vascular net-work, which gives
them a red colour very different from the colour of the
cutaneous papillÃ¦; but the non-appearance of the cutaneous
net-work is owing to the pressure of the atmospheric
air, and especially to the contraction which it occasions
in the small vessels. Observe in fact the fÅ“tus as
it comes from the womb of its mother; its skin is as red
as the mucous membranes, and if its papillÃ¦ were a little
longer, it would resemble almost exactly the internal surface
of the intestines. Who does not know moreover,
that the vascular net-work surrounding the cutaneous papillÃ¦,
is rendered evident by fine injections, so as to change
their colour entirely?</p>

<p>That in the stomach this vascular net-work continuous
with the exhalants furnishes the gastric juice, and that
in the intestines it intermixes with the origin of the absorbents,
so that these embrace the villi, we cannot doubt
after the experiments and observations of anatomists who
have recently engaged themselves in investigating the
lymphatic system. But this does not prevent the base of
these villi from being nervous, and them from performing
upon the mucous membranes the same functions that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
the papillÃ¦ do upon the cutaneous organ. This manner
of regarding them by explaining their existence generally
observed upon all the mucous surfaces, appears to me to
be much more conformable to the plan of nature, than to
suppose them in each place with different and often opposite
functions.</p>

<p>Besides it is difficult to decide the question by ocular
observation. The delicacy of these elongations conceals
their structure, even from our microscopical instruments,
agents from which anatomy and physiology do not appear
to me to have derived much assistance, because
when we see obscurely, each sees in his own way and
according to his own wishes. It is then the observation
of vital properties that should especially guide us; now,
it is evident to judge by them, that the villi have the
nature I have attributed to them. The following experiment
served to demonstrate to me the influence of the
papillary body upon the cutaneous sensibility; it succeeds
also upon the mucous membranes. Remove the epidermis
in any part and irritate the papillary body with a
sharp stilet; the animal is agitated, cries out and gives
marks of acute pain. Slide afterwards, through a small
opening made in the skin, a pointed stilet into the sub-cutaneous
cellular texture, and irritate the internal surface
of the corion; the animal remains quiet and makes no
noise, unless some nervous filaments accidentally struck
make him suffer. Hence it follows very evidently, that
it is upon the external surface of the skin that its sensibility
resides, that the nerves pass through the corion without
contributing to its texture, and that their expansion
takes place on the papillary body. It is precisely so with
the mucous surfaces. Observe that this circumstance
coincides very well with the functions of the two surfaces,
which receive by their free portion the action of
external bodies, to which they are foreign by their adhering
portion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span></p>

<p>The papillÃ¦ exhibit very great varieties. On the
tongue, in the small intestines, in the stomach and in the
gall-bladder, they are remarkable for their length. The
Å“sophagus, the large intestines, the bladder, all the excretory
ducts have those that are less evident; these last
especially and the urethra in particular, are almost smooth
in their whole mucous surface. We can scarcely distinguish
the papillÃ¦ in the frontal, sphenoidal, maxillary
sinuses, &amp;c.</p>

<p>These small nervous eminences are sufficiently distinct
and separate upon the tongue. In the nasal fossÃ¦, the
stomach and the intestines, they are so near together and
at the same time so delicate, that the membrane has at
first view an uniform and smooth appearance, though it
is covered with these elongations. Each papilla is simple;
no bifurcation is ever observed at its extremity.
All appear to have a pyramidal form, if we can judge at
least by those which are the most evident.</p>

<p>Are they susceptible of a species of erection? It has
been believed with regard to those of the tongue, which
become erect, it is said, to perceive tastes, and with regard
to those of the nose, which receive odours more
efficaciously in this state of erection, which is in the sensitive
phenomena on a small scale, what the erection of
the corpora cavernosa is on a large one. I do not believe
that any exact experiment can prove this fact. Moreover,
it would be necessary then that the intestinal, vesical
papillÃ¦, &amp;c. should be in permanent erection, since
they are almost always in contact with foreign substances.</p>


<h4>II. <i>Parts common to the Organization of the Mucous
System.</i></h4>

<p>Besides the blood vessels, the exhalants and the absorbents
which contribute to the structure of this system as
to that of all the others, it exhibits also a common organ,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
which is found almost always separate elsewhere, but
which is here especially designed for it. This common
organ is of a glandular nature; we shall now examine it.</p>


<h5><i>Of the Mucous Glands and of the Fluids which they
secrete.</i></h5>

<p>The mucous glands exist in all the system of this name.
Situated beneath the corion or even in its thickness, they
pour out incessantly through imperceptible openings a
mucilaginous fluid which lubricates its free surface, and
which defends it from the impression of the bodies with
which it is in contact, and at the same time favours the
course of these bodies.</p>

<p>These glands are very apparent in the bronchia, palate,
the Å“sophagus and the intestines, in which they take the
names of the anatomists who have accurately described
them, and where they make in many places evident projections
upon the mucous surface. They are less apparent
in the bladder, the womb, the gall-bladder, the vesiculÃ¦
seminales, &amp;c.; but the mucus that moistens them
clearly demonstrates their existence. In fact, since on
the one hand this fluid is analogous on all the mucous surfaces,
and, on the other, in those in which the glands are
apparent, it is evidently furnished by them, it must be
secreted in the same way in those in which the glands are
less evident. The identity of the secreted fluids supposes
in fact the identity of the secretory organs. It appears
that where these glands are hidden from our view, nature
compensates for their delicacy by their number. Besides,
there are animals in which, in the intestines especially,
they form by their vast number, a kind of new layer, in
addition to those of which we have spoken. In man
this is remarkable in the palatine arch, in the pillars of
the velum, on the internal surface of the lips, the cheeks,
&amp;c. &amp;c. There is then this great difference between the
mucous and the serous membranes, that the fluid which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
lubricates one is furnished by secretion, whilst that which
moistens the others is from exhalation.</p>

<p>The size of the mucous glands varies; those of the
velum of the palate, those of the mouth, &amp;c. are the
largest; they become insensible in the greatest number of
mucous surfaces. I dissected two subjects that died of a
pulmonary catarrh, and in them the glands of the trachea
and bronchia, which are, as we know, very apparent,
were not enlarged; the membrane alone appeared to be
affected. Besides, we do not yet know the injuries of
these glands, like those of the analogous organs, which
are more apparent from their size. They are in general
of a rounded form but with many varieties. No membrane
appears to cover them. They have, like the salivary
glands and the pancreas, only the cellular texture for
an envelope. Their texture is more dense and compact
than these last glands; but little cellular texture is found
in them; they are soft, vascular, and appear when opened
very much like the prostate gland. I cannot say whether
nerves penetrate them; analogy indicates it, for all the
principal glands receive them.</p>


<h5><i>Mucous Fluids.</i></h5>

<p>We know but little of the composition of the mucous
fluids, because in the natural state, it is difficult to collect
them, and in the morbid, in which their quantity increases
as in catarrhs for example, this composition is
probably changed. We know that in general they are
unsavoury, insipid, and but slightly soluble in water, in
that even which is raised to the highest temperature;
they become putrid with difficulty. In fact they remain
a long time unchanged in the nose, exposed to the contact
of a moist air; in the intestines, they serve, without
danger to them, as an envelope for putrid substances, &amp;c.;
taken from the body and subjected to different experiments,
they give results conformable to these facts. All<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
the acids act upon them and colour them differently; exposed
to a dry air, they thicken by evaporation, and are
often even reduced to small shining laminÃ¦. The nasal mucus
especially exhibits this phenomenon. Fourcroy has
given in detail the analysis of this mucus; he has also
given that of the tracheal mucus. But we must not apply
rigorously to the analogous fluids our knowledge of the
composition of these. It is sufficient in fact to examine
a certain number of these fluids, to be convinced that they
are not the same in any two places, that more or less
thick, more or less uniform, different in their colour,
their odour even, &amp;c. they vary in the principles that
constitute them, as the membranes which furnish them
vary in their structure, in the number and size of their
glands, in the thickness of their corion, the form of their
papillÃ¦, the state of their vascular and nervous systems,
&amp;c. I am far from being certain that the gastric juice is
a mucous juice; it is even probable that exhalation furnishes
it, the glands of the stomach throwing out a different
fluid by the way of secretion. But this assertion is
not accurately demonstrated, and perhaps hereafter it will
be proved that this juice, so different from the other mucous
juices, is however one of them, and that its properties
are distinct only because the structure of the mucous
surface of the stomach is not the same as that of the other
analogous surfaces.</p>

<p>The functions of the mucous fluids in the animal economy
are not ambiguous. The first of these functions is to
defend the mucous membranes from the impression of
the bodies with which they are in contact, and all which,
as we have observed, are heterogeneous to that of the animal.
These fluids form upon their respective surfaces a
layer which supplies, to a certain extent, by its extreme
tenuity, the absence of their epidermis. Thus where this
membrane is very apparent, as upon the lips, the glans<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
penis, at the entrance of the nose and in general at all the
origins of the mucous system, these fluids are not very
abundant. The skin has only an oily layer, infinitely less
evident than the mucous of which we are treating, because
its epidermis is very distinct.</p>

<p>This use of the mucous fluids explains why they are
more abundant where heterogeneous bodies remain some
time, as in the bladder, at the extremity of the rectum,
&amp;c. than where these bodies are only to pass, as in the
ureters, and the excretory ducts generally.</p>

<p>Hence why when the impression of a body would be
injurious, these fluids are poured out in greater quantity
upon their surfaces. The sound which enters the urethra
and remains in it, the instrument that is left in the vagina
to compress a polypus, that which remains some time
with the same view in the nasal fossÃ¦, the canal fixed in
the lachrymal sac to remove the obstruction, that which
is introduced into the Å“sophagus to assist interrupted
deglutition, always produce, upon the portions of the mucous
surface that corresponds to them, a more abundant
secretion of the fluid which is constantly poured out, a
true catarrh. This is one of the principal reasons that
renders it difficult to keep elastic sounds in the wind-pipe.
The abundance of the mucus that is then secreted, by
closing the openings in the instrument, renders frequent
introductions necessary, and can even threaten the patient
with suffocation, as Desault himself has observed, though
however he obtained great advantage from this means, as
I have shown in his surgical works. I ought even to say,
that since the publication of the Treatise on the Membranes,
I attempted to fix a sound in the air tube of a dog,
and that the animal died at the end of some time, having
the bronchia filled with a frothy fluid which appeared to
have suffocated him.</p>

<p>It appears then that every considerable excitement of
the mucous surfaces produces a remarkable increase of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
action. But how can this excitement, which does not
take place immediately upon the gland, have so great an
influence upon it? for, as we have said, these glands are
always under the membrane, and consequently separated
by it from the irritating bodies. It appears that it is
owing to a general modification of the glandular sensibility,
which is capable of being brought into action by
any irritation upon the extremity of the excretory ducts,
as I shall prove in the glandular system.</p>

<p>It is to the susceptibility that the mucous glands have
of feeling the irritation made at the extremity of their
ducts, that must be referred the artificial catarrhs with
which Vauquelin has been affected by respiring the
vapours of the oxy-muriatic acid, the mucous discharge
that attends the presence of a polypus, of any tumour in
the vagina, of a stone in the bladder, &amp;c. the frequency
of fluor albus in women who are immoderate in the use
of sexual intercourse, the more abundant discharge of the
mucus from the nostrils of those who take snuff, &amp;c.
In all these cases, there is evidently excitement at the
extremity of the mucous ducts. I refer also to this excitement
the mucous discharge that takes place, from
stimulating the end of the nipple of a woman who does
not give suck, the copious secretions which the presence
of an irritating body produces in the intestines, secretions
which especially furnish the matter of diarrhÅ“as, the
gastric derangements which succeed an indigestion that
has allowed to remain on the mucous surface of the
stomach substances not digested and consequently irritating;
these derangements are in fact real catarrhs of the
membrane of the stomach, catarrhs which most often are
not connected with bilious turgescence. I could add
many other examples of the mucous secretions increased
by an irritation upon the surface of the membranes, at
the extremity of the excretory ducts; these will be sufficient
to give an idea of the others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span></p>

<p>All these excitements produce a kind of inflammation,
the peculiarity of which is to contract at first for some
time the glandular ducts, and arrest the secretion, which
they afterwards excite in great quantity. When the
mucous fluids have flowed abundantly for some time, they
gradually diminish though the cause continues; thus less
mucus is discharged from the urethra in proportion after
the sound has remained in it a month, than when first introduced;
but almost always as long as the cause continues,
the mucous discharge is greater than in a natural state.</p>

<p>Blisters are much employed in medicine on the cutaneous
organ, to dispel, according to some, the morbific
humour, and overcome, according to others, a natural
irritation by an artificial one. Why should we not also
in many cases irritate the mucous surfaces? why not act
upon the pituitary membrane, upon the glans penis, upon
the membrane of the urethra, upon the pharynx, &amp;c. and
especially upon the uvula which is so sensible? why, instead
of epispastics upon the perineum and sacrum, should
we not introduce a sound into the urethra for a paralysis
of the bladder? Instead of acting in hemiplegia upon
the cutaneous organ, I have already twice employed the
following means; I have introduced a sound into the
urethra, one in each nasal fossa, and at the same time, a
surgeon irritated at intervals the uvula; the patients appeared
to be much more excited than by blisters. Very
strong purgative enemas and emetics prove the advantage
of the excitement of the mucous membranes in this case.
Would it not often be better in ophthalmia, to produce an
artificial catarrh in the nostril of the diseased side, than to
put a blister or seton in the neck? I have once tried it;
it did not succeed; but the ophthalmia was of long standing;
I propose to repeat these experiments at the HÃ´tel
Dieu upon a great number of patients. I think that we
might often in diseases make use of mucous excitements
instead of cutaneous, with much more advantage, because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
in the mucous system the contact of a body is sufficient,
and it is not necessary to produce, by removing the epidermis,
a kind of ulcer.</p>

<p>The mucous membranes by the continual secretion of
which they are the seat, enjoy a principal part in the animal
economy. We ought to consider them as one of the
great emunctories by which the residue of nutrition constantly
escapes, and consequently as one of the principal
agents of the habitual decomposition which removes from
living bodies the particles that, having for some time contributed
to the composition of the solids, are afterwards
to become heterogeneous to them. Observe in fact that
the mucous fluids do not enter the circulation, but go out
of the body; that of the bladder, the ureters and the
urethra, with the urine; that of the vesiculÃ¦ seminales
and the different ducts with the semen; that of the nostrils
by the act of blowing the nose; that of the mouth,
in part by evaporation and in part by the anus with the
excrements; that of the bronchia, by pulmonary exhalation,
which arises principally, as I shall say, from the
solution of this mucous fluid in the inspired air; those of
the Å“sophagus, the stomach, the intestines, the gall-bladder,
&amp;c. with the excrements, of which they often form
in the ordinary state a part almost as considerable as the
residue of the aliments, and which they even compose
almost entirely in some cases of dysentery and fever, in
which the quantity of matter voided is evidently disproportioned
to that taken in, &amp;c. Let us observe upon this
subject that there are always some errors in the analyses
of the fluids in contact with the membranes of which we
are speaking, as in that of the urine, the bile, the gastric
juices, &amp;c. because it is very difficult and even impossible
to separate the mucous fluids from them.</p>

<p>If we recollect what has been previously said upon the
extent of the two general mucous surfaces, which is equal
and even superior to the extent of the cutaneous organ,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
and if we afterwards consider that these two great surfaces
are constantly throwing out mucous fluids, we shall
perceive how important this evacuation must be in the
economy, and of what mischief its derangement must become
the source. It is undoubtedly to this law of nature
which wishes to have every mucous fluid thrown out,
that must be attributed, in part in the fÅ“tus, the presence
of the unctuous fluid of which the gall-bladder is full,
the meconium which loads the intestines, &amp;c. fluids which
appear to be but a mass of mucous juices, which being
unable to pass off, remain until birth, without being absorbed,
upon the respective organs on which they have
been secreted.</p>

<p>The mucous fluids are not the only ones that are thrown
out, and are in this way excrementitious substances to
the economy; this is the case with almost all the fluids
separated from the mass of blood by secretion; this is
evident as it respects the greatest part of the bile; probably
the saliva, the pancreatic juice and the tears are also
thrown out with the excrements, and their colour alone
prevents them from being distinguished like the bile. I
do not even know if, by reflecting on many phenomena,
we might not attempt to establish as a general principle,
that every fluid separated by secretion does not enter the
circulation again, that this phenomenon belongs only to
the fluids separated by exhalation, as those of the serous
cavities, of the articulations, of the cellular texture, of
the medullary organ, &amp;c.; that all the fluids are thus
either excrementitious or recrementitious, and that no
one is excremento recrementitious as the common division
implies. The bile in the gall-bladder, the urine in the
bladder, the semen in the vesiculÃ¦ seminales, are certainly
absorbed; but it is not the fluid itself which re-enters
the circulation; it is only its most delicate parts,
some of its principles which we do not exactly know,
probably the serous and lymphatic part; this does not re<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>semble
the absorption of the pleura and other analogous
membranes, in which the fluid re-enters the blood as it
came out of it.</p>

<p>That which is certain on the subject of the excretion
of the secreted fluids is, that I have never been able to
produce absorption of the bile by the lymphatics by injecting
it into the cellular texture of an animal; it produces
there inflammation and afterwards suppuration.
We know that urine effused is not absorbed and that it
destroys every part it touches, whilst that effusions of
lymph and blood are easily discussed. There is as it respects
the composition an essential difference between the
blood and the secreted fluids. The exhaled fluids on the
contrary, as the serum, in this respect resemble it very
much.</p>

<p>Another very evident proof that all the mucous fluids
are designed to be thrown out, is, that when they have
continued for some time in any quantity upon their respective
surfaces, they create there a painful sensation of
which nature relieves us by various means. Thus the
cough, which is the constant result of an accumulation of
mucus in the bronchia, serves to expel it; thus vomiting
in gastric derangements answers the same purpose as it
respects the mucous juices accumulated in the stomach,
whose presence produces a weight and even pain, though
the membranes be not affected. We cough at will, because
it is the diaphragm and intercostals by which this
function is performed; we do not seek in medicine for
any means to excite it. But as we cannot vomit at will,
and as the presence of mucous juices often by fatiguing
the stomach, does not irritate it sufficiently to produce a
contraction, art has recourse to various emetics. We
know what a painful sensation of weight the continuance
of mucus accumulated in the frontal, maxillary, sinuses,
&amp;c. occasions, when there is a catarrh of a portion of the
pituitary membrane. The region of the bladder is for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
the same reason, in catarrhs of this organ, the seat of a
troublesome and even painful sensation.</p>

<p>In general, the sensation which arises from the presence
of the mucous juices remaining too long and in too great
quantity upon their respective surfaces, varies because, as
we shall see, each part of the mucous system has its peculiar
mode of sensibility; so that the pain is not the same
in each, though produced by the same cause. I would
only observe that this sensation does not resemble that
which arises from the tearing or the acute irritation of
our parts; it is an uneasy, inconvenient sensation, difficult
to be borne. Every one knows that which arises
from mucus accumulated in the nasal fossÃ¦, when the
nose has not been blown for a long time, that disagreeable
one that accompanies gastric derangements, &amp;c. Those
who have a weakness of the lachrymal sac in which the
tears, on account of this, accumulate during the night,
wake up with a sensation of weight, of which they are
relieved by evacuating the sac by pressure, if the puncta
lachrymalia are open.</p>


<h5><i>Blood Vessels.</i></h5>

<p>The mucous membranes receive a very great number
of vessels. The remarkable redness that distinguishes
them would be sufficient to prove it, if injections did not
demonstrate it; this redness is not everywhere uniform.
It is almost nothing in the sinuses of the face, in the internal
ear, of which the membranes are rather whitish,
and which appear so especially, because their extreme
delicacy allows the bone upon which they are applied
to be seen very distinctly. In the bladder, in the great
intestines, in the excretories, &amp;c. this colour, though still
very pale, is a little more evident; it becomes very much
so in the stomach, the small intestines, the vagina and in
the pituitary and palatine membranes. In the gall-blad<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>der
we cannot distinguish it, because the bile always
covers the mucous surface in the dead body.</p>

<p>This colour depends upon a very extensive vascular net-work,
the branches of which, after having passed through
the mucous corion, and ramifying there, divide and spread
ad infinitum on its surface, embracing the papillary body
and covered only by the epidermis.</p>

<p>It is the superficial position of these vessels and consequently
their want of support on one side, that exposes
them frequently to ruptures from considerable shocks, as
happens on the surface of the bronchia from a severe
cough, on that of the ear and the nose from a violent
blow on the head. We know that hemorrhage of the
mucous system bordering on the brain, is a common accident
from concussions and wounds of the head. Hence
why the least gravel makes the ureters bleed; why one
of the signs of stone in the bladder is the passing of blood;
why a blunt sound carefully introduced is so often withdrawn
bloody from the urethra; why the least effort
made with instruments carried upon polypi, into a fistula
lachrymalis or into the nostrils, produces hemorrhage. I
have already observed that we must carefully distinguish
these hemorrhages from those furnished by the exhalants,
and which do not suppose any vascular rupture.</p>

<p>It is also the superficial position of the vessels of the
mucous system, which makes its portions visible, as the
red edge of the lips, the glans penis, &amp;c. often serve to
show us the state of the circulation. Thus in the different
species of asphyxia, in submersion, strangulation, &amp;c.
these parts are remarkably livid, an effect of the passage
of the venous blood, which has undergone no change from
the want of respiration, into the extremities of the arterial
system.</p>

<p>The long continued exposure of the mucous system to
the air, often makes it lose the redness that characterizes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
it, and it then assumes the appearance of the skin, as has
been observed by Sabatier in treating of prolapsus of the
womb and vagina, which, from this circumstance, have
sometimes so misled some people, as to make them believe
it a case of hermaphrodism.</p>

<p>An important question presents itself in the history
of the vascular system of the mucous membranes, viz.
whether this system admits more or less blood according
to different circumstances. As the organs within which
these membranes are spread, are almost all susceptible of
contraction and dilatation, as we see in the stomach, the
intestines, the bladder, &amp;c. it has been thought that during
the dilatation, the vessels being more expanded, receive
more blood, and that during the contraction on the contrary,
being folded up, as it were choaked, they admit
but a small quantity of this fluid which then flows into
the neighbouring organs. Chaussier has made an application
of these principles to the stomach, whose circulation
he has considered as being alternately inverse of that
of the omentum, which receives during the vacuity of
this organ, the blood which this when it is contracted
cannot admit. An analogous use has also been attributed
to the spleen since the time of Lieutaud. The following
is what the inspection of animals opened during abstinence
and at different periods of digestion, has shown me upon
this point.</p>

<p>1st. During the fulness of the stomach the vessels are
more apparent on the exterior of this viscus, than when
it is empty. Within, the mucous surface is not more
red, sometimes it has appeared to me to be less so. 2d.
The omentum, less extended during the fulness of the
stomach, exhibits nearly the same number of vessels, as
long, but more tortuous, than when it is empty. If they
contain less blood, the difference is hardly sensible. I
would observe, that in order to distinguish this well, it
is necessary to take care that in opening the animal, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
blood does not fall on the omentum which presents itself,
and thus prevent its state from being ascertained. This
is besides a necessary consequence of the arrangement of
the vascular system of the stomach. In fact the great
stomachic coronary being situated transversely between
it and the omentum, and furnishing branches to each, it
is evident that when the stomach is lodged between the
layers of the omentum by separating these layers, and
this by applying itself upon it becomes shorter; it is
evident, I say, that the branches which it receives from
the coronary cannot be equally applied to it also. In
order to do this, it would be necessary that they should go
from one to the other without the intermediate trunk
that cuts them at right angles; then, in distending, the
stomach would separate them as it does the omentum,
and would be lodged between them; whereas it pushes
them before it with their common trunk, the stomachic
coronary, and makes them fold. 3d. I am confident that
there is no such constant relation between the size of the
spleen and the emptiness or fulness of the stomach, and
that these two circumstances coincide necessarily, and that
if the first organ increases or diminishes under different
circumstances, it is not always precisely the reverse of
the stomach. I first made, like Lieutaud, experiments
upon dogs to convince myself of it; but the inequality in
the size and age of those that were brought to me, making
me fear that I should not be able to compare their spleens
correctly, I repeated them upon guinea-pigs of the same
litter and size, and examined at the same time, some
when the stomach was empty and others when it was
full. I have almost always found the size of the spleen
nearly equal, or at least the difference was not very sensible.
Yet in other experiments, I have seen under
various circumstances, inequalities in the size of the spleen
and especially in the weight of this viscus; but it was
indifferently during or after digestion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span></p>

<p>It appears from all this, that if during the vacuity of
the stomach, there is a reflux of blood towards the omentum
and spleen, this reflux is less than it has been commonly
said to be. Besides during this state of vacuity,
the numerous folds of the mucous membrane of this
viscus leaving it, as we have said above, almost as much
surface and consequently as many vessels as during fulness,
the blood can circulate in it almost as freely. It
has no real obstacles but in the tortuous courses, and not
in the obstruction, compression and choaking of these
vessels by the contraction of the stomach; now this obstacle
is easily surmounted, or rather it is not one as I
have proved in my Researches upon Death. As to the
other hollow organs, it is difficult to examine the circulation
of the neighbouring parts during their fulness
and vacuity, as the vessels of these are not superficial
as in the omentum, and as they themselves are not insulated
like the spleen. We can only then, to decide the
question, see the state of the mucous membranes on their
internal face; now this face has always appeared to me to
be as red during the contraction as during the dilatation.</p>

<p>Besides I only give this as a fact without pretending
to draw from it any consequence in opposition to the common
opinion. It is possible in fact that though the quantity
of blood may be nearly always the same, the rapidity
of the circulation being increased, more of this fluid may
consequently in a given time enter it when it is full; which
appears to be necessary to the greater secretion that then
takes place of the mucous fluids, a secretion excited by
the presence of the substances in contact with the surfaces
of the same name. For example, there is no doubt that
there is three or even four times as much mucus secreted
in the urethra, when a sound fills it, as when it is empty;
now the blood must be in proportion.</p>

<p>The remarkable redness of the mucous system, the
analogy of respiration in which the blood flows through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
the mucous surface of the bronchia the well known experiment
of a bladder filled with blood and immersed in
oxygen, by which means the blood becomes red, have
induced a belief that the blood being separated from the
atmospheric air only by a thin pellicle or some of the
mucous surfaces, as upon the pituitary, the palatine, the
glans penis, &amp;c. assumed there a redder colour, either from
getting rid of a portion of its carbonic acid gas, or by
combining with the oxygen of the air, and that these
membranes thus performed functions accessory to those
of the lungs. The experiments of Jurine upon the cutaneous
organ, experiments adopted by many celebrated
philosophers, seem to strengthen this conjecture.</p>

<p>I tried the following experiment to ascertain this fact.
I drew through a wound made in the abdomen a portion
of intestine which I tied at one point, I afterwards reduced
it, keeping out a small portion only which I opened and
by which I introduced atmospheric air, which filled the
whole portion situated on this side of the ligature. I
afterwards tied the intestine below the opening, and reduced
the whole of it. At the end of an hour, the
animal being opened, I compared the blood of the mesenteric
veins which arose from the portion of intestine distended
with air, with the blood of the other mesenteric
veins arising from the rest of the canal. No difference
of colour was manifest; the internal surface of the distended
portion of the intestine was not of a more brilliant
red. I thought I should obtain a more evident effect, by
repeating with oxygen the same experiment upon another
animal; but I perceived no greater variety in the colour
of the blood. As upon the mucous membranes which
are ordinarily in contact with the air, this fluid is constantly
changing and is agitated by a perpetual motion,
and as in the preceding experiment it remained stagnant,
I attempted to produce the same effect in the intestines.
I made two openings in the abdomen, and drew out at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
each a portion of the intestinal canal; having opened these
two portions, I fitted to one the tube of a bladder full of
oxygen and to the other that of an empty bladder; I afterwards
compressed the full bladder, so as to make the
oxygen pass into the other, by going through this portion
of intestine, left in the abdomen that the heat might support
the circulation in it. The oxygen was thus many
times sent from one bladder to another, taking its course
through the intestine, which, on account of its contractility
is more difficult than it at first seems to be. The
abdomen being afterwards opened I found no difference
between the venous blood returning from this portion of
intestine, and that which flowed from the others. The
superficial position of the mesenteric veins, covered only
by a fine and transparent layer of peritoneum, their size,
if the animal be rather large, render this sort of comparison
very easy.</p>

<p>I perceive that we cannot infer from what takes place
in the intestines, what happens in the pituitary, palatine
membrane, &amp;c. because though analogous, the organization
may be different. We cannot here as in the intestines
examine the venous blood returning from the part;
but, 1st, if we consider that in animals who have respired
oxygen for some time, we see the palatine and pituitary
membranes more red; 2d, if we reflect that the lividity
of the different parts of this membrane, in those destroyed
by asphyxia by the carbonic acid gas, depends not on the
immediate contact of this gas upon the membrane, but
upon the passage of venous blood into the arterial system,
as my experiments have, I think, demonstrated; 3d, if
we remark finally that in these circumstances the contact
of the air does not change, after death, the lividity
which the venous blood gives to the mucous membranes,
although the skin be then much more permeable to every
kind of aeriform fluid; we shall see that it is at least
necessary to suspend our judgment upon the colouring of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
the blood in the mucous membranes, until further observations
have decided the question.</p>

<p>The following experiment may also throw some light
upon the subject. I have inflated the peritoneal cavity of
several guinea-pigs with carbonic acid gas, with hydrogen,
oxygen and atmospheric air, to see if I could effect
through a serous membrane what I could not make succeed
in a mucous; I have not, after these experiments, found
any difference in the colour of the blood of the abdominal
system; it was always the same as in the common guinea-pig
which I killed for comparison.</p>

<p>I think however that I have remarked many times,
both in frogs and animals with red and warm blood, such
as cats and guinea-pigs, that the infiltration of oxygen into
the cellular texture gives, at the end of some time, a
much brighter colour to the blood, than that which this
fluid exhibits in artificial emphysemas produced by carbonic
acid gas, hydrogen and atmospheric air, in all which
the colour of the blood scarcely differs at all from what
is natural. But in other cases oxygen has had no influence
upon the colour of the blood; so that notwithstanding
having made many experiments upon this point, I am
unable to give any general result. It appears that the
tonic forces of the cellular texture and of the parietes of
the vessels which are spread upon this texture, receive a
very variable influence from the contact of the gases, and
that according to the nature of this influence, the fibres
crisping and contracting more or less, render these parts
more or less permeable, either to the aeriform fluids that
tend to escape from the blood in order to unite with that of
the emphysema, or to this last fluid, if it tends to combine
with the blood, which no doubt produces the varieties I
have observed.</p>

<p>The red colour of the mucous system is analogous to
that of the muscular system. It does not depend essentially
on the blood circulating in the small arteries of this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
system. It arises from the colouring portion of the blood
combined with the mucous texture, especially in the deep
part of the organs; for at the origin of the mucous surfaces,
this colour appears to be principally owing to the
blood in circulation; in fact asphyxia does not render
so livid the deep mucous surfaces, as it does those which
are superficial and in communication with the skin. The
black blood arrives immediately to these by the last arteries,
and tinges them as we see. In syncope in which
the heart being affected no longer sends blood into the
arteries, we know that this portion of the mucous system
becomes instantly white.</p>

<p>Besides the red colour of the deeper portions, can, like
that of the muscles, be removed by repeated washing and
frequently changing the water. Yet the water in which
they have been washed is not as red as that used for the
muscles.</p>

<p>The instant a mucous surface is plunged into boiling
water, however red it may be, as that of the intestines
and the stomach, it instantly whitens. The action of the
nitric, sulphuric and muriatic acids produces in it also a
sudden whiteness.</p>

<p>This colour of the mucous surfaces acquires a remarkable
intensity in inflammation. The redness becomes
then extremely deep on account of the quantity of blood
that is accumulated in the capillary system. It is particularly
in dysentery that the internal surface of the
intestines exhibits this phenomenon in a striking degree.
I ought however to observe to those who open dead
bodies, that they never should lose sight of the original
tinge of the portion of the mucous system they examine,
since each of the divisions of this system exhibits in its
shades remarkable differences. If the membrane of the
bladder, the rectum, &amp;c. is found as red as that of the
stomach in its natural state, then pronounce that there
had been inflammation; if the redness of the sinuses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
equals that which is natural to the bladder and the rectum,
decide that inflammation had existed in them. There is,
as I have said, a scale of colour for the mucous system.
It is then essential to have an accurate knowledge of this
scale, a type to which we can refer the inflammatory state
in the examination of dead bodies.</p>


<h5><i>Exhalants.</i></h5>

<p>Does exhalation take place upon the mucous surfaces?
The analogy of the skin seems to indicate it; for it is
well proved that the sweat is not a transudation through
the inorganic pores of the cutaneous surface, but a real
transmission by vessels of a peculiar nature and continuous
with the arterial system.</p>

<p>It appears at first that the pulmonary perspiration
which takes place upon the mucous surface of the bronchia,
which has so much relation with that of the skin,
which increases and diminishes according as this diminishes
or increases, and the matter of which is probably of
the same nature; it appears, I say, that the pulmonary
perspiration is made at least in great part by the system
of exhalant vessels, and that if the combination of the
oxygen of the air with the hydrogen of the blood contributes
to produce it, during the act of respiration, it is
but in very small quantity, and it is the portion that is
purely aqueous. Besides, this last hypothesis of modern
chemists, contradictory to the production of all the other
fluids thrown out by the mucous surfaces, appears to me
ill adapted to explain the formation of this. When the
same phenomenon is produced in many places, and the
explanation that is given of it is applicable only to one,
we should be suspicious of this explanation.</p>

<p>It should be observed in regard to the pulmonary perspiration,
that the solution of the mucous fluid which lubricates
the bronchia, in the air constantly inspired and
expired, furnishes a considerable portion of this vapour<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
which, insensible in summer, is very evident in winter,
on account of the condensation of the air. The mucous
juices are dissolved like every other fluid; for wherever
there is atmospheric air, heat and moisture, there is evaporation.
Here this evaporation is even a means which
nature employs to rid herself, as I have said, of the mucous
juices. If they are too abundant, as in a cold, then
the quantity of air which serves as a vehicle to them, not
increasing in proportion, it is necessary that there should
be another mode of evacuation; this is expectoration
which compensates for what the air cannot remove by
solution.</p>

<p>The intestinal juice which Haller has especially considered,
but which appears to be in much less quantity
than he thought it, the Å“sophagean and gastric juices,
particularly this last which has been supposed to be distinct
from the mucous juices, are probably deposited by
exhalation upon their respective mucous surfaces. But
in general it is very difficult to distinguish with precision
what belongs in these organs to the exhalant system, from
that which is furnished by the system of mucous glands,
which, as we have said, are everywhere subjacent to
them. Thus we constantly see the mucous fluids of the
Å“sophagus, the stomach and the intestines, mixing with
the Å“sophagean, gastric and intestinal fluids.</p>

<p>As on the one hand the blood vessels ramify almost
naked on the mucous surfaces, and as on the other these
vessels are always the origin of the exhalants, it is evident,
that these have but a short course to run to arrive
at their surfaces; they are rather pores than distinct vessels.
Hence why no doubt the blood has so great a
tendency to escape by the exhalants; why consequently
hemorrhages without rupture are so frequent in the mucous
system; why this affection can be classed in the
diseases of this system, &amp;c. &amp;c. No other, by the arrangement
of the arteries, offers to the exhalants so short a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
course between their origin and termination. Often even,
as I have said, we make the blood of these vessels ooze
in the dead body through their exhalants.</p>


<h5><i>Absorbents.</i></h5>

<p>The absorption of the mucous membranes is evidently
proved, 1st, by those of chyle and of drinks on the intestinal
surfaces, of the venereal virus upon the glans penis
and the canal of the urethra, of the variolous when the
gums are rubbed with it, of the serous portion of the
bile, the urine and the semen, when they remain in their
respective reservoirs. 2d. When, in the paralysis of the
fleshy fibres that terminate the rectum, substances are
accumulated at the extremity of this intestine, these substances
often become hard, an effect probably of an absorption
of the soft parts. 3d. There have been various
cases in which the urine has been almost wholly absorbed
by the mucous surface of the bladder, where there have
been insurmountable obstacles in the urethra. 4th. If we
respire, by means of a tube, the air of a large vessel filled
with the exhalations of turpentine, so that these vapours
can only act upon the mucous surface of the bronchia,
the urine has the peculiar odour that always arises from
the use of this substance, the exhalations from which have
been introduced into the blood by the means of absorption,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>Whatever may be the mode of this absorption, it appears
that it does not take place in a constant and uninterrupted
manner, like those of the serous membranes, in
which the exhalant and absorbent systems are in a regular
and continual alternation of action. There is scarcely any
but the chylous absorption, that of drinks, and that of
the aqueous portion of the secreted fluids remaining in a
reservoir as they come from their glands, that constantly
take place. Nothing is more variable than the other absorptions.
Under the same influence, the glans takes up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
or leaves the venereal virus; the internal surface of the
bronchia sometimes admits and sometimes refuses admittance
to contagious miasmata. There are more cases of
retention in which the urine is not absorbed entirely,
than there are where this absorption takes place, &amp;c. &amp;c.
The innumerable varieties of the vital forces of the mucous
membranes, varieties produced by those of the stimuli
with which they are in contact, explain these phenomena.
If these forces are raised or diminished a little, the absorption
is altered, even that which is natural, as that of
the chyle. Take a purgative; it contracts, shuts even
the mouth of the absorbents of the intestinal canal; as
long as the irritation continues, all the drinks that are
taken pass off by the anus; at the end of four or five
hours, the absorbents gradually recover their natural tone
and absorption recommences. In these cases, the first
discharges are only the intestinal matters, the others are
the copious drinks that have been taken. There are many
diseases in which, the sensibility of the chylous absorbents
being too much raised, they are no longer in relation
with the aliments, they take up with difficulty the residue
of them, &amp;c. Deficiency of action produces the same
phenomenon; in absorption in fact it is a middle degree
of sensibility of the organ which produces it, a degree
below or above which it cannot take place.</p>

<p>All the mucous absorbents appear to go to the thoracic
duct.</p>


<h5><i>Nerves.</i></h5>

<p>I would remark that at all the origins of the mucous system,
where the animal sensibility is very great and where
it places us, like the skin, in relation with external bodies,
cerebral nerves are distributed. The pituitary and palatine
membranes, the conjunctiva, the mucous surface of
the rectum, the glans penis, the prepuce, &amp;c. exhibit
this fact very evidently. There are hardly any nervous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
filaments coming from the ganglions in these different
places.</p>

<p>On the contrary, this last species of nerves is the predominant
one in the intestines, in all the excretories, in
the reservoirs of the secreted fluids, &amp;c. places where the
organic sensibility is the most evident.</p>

<h3>ARTICLE THIRD.<br />

<small>PROPERTIES OF THE MUCOUS SYSTEM.</small></h3>


<h4>I. <i>Properties of Texture.</i></h4>

<p>Extensibility and contractility are much less in this
system than they at first appear to be, on account of the
numerous folds which it exhibits in the hollow organs
during their contraction, folds which are developed only
during extension, as we have seen. Yet these two properties
become very evident in some cases. The excretories
are capable of taking a size much larger than is
natural to them. This is seen in the ureters in particular,
which are sometimes found as large as an intestine.
The ductus choledochus and the pancreatic duct have
often also these dilatations. The urethra and the salivary
ducts appear to be less extensible than the others. If
they have ever so little obstacles from strictures, contractions,
&amp;c. they break rather than stretch; hence various
urinary and salivary fistulas.</p>

<p>Hence there is, as we see, many varieties in the degrees
of the extensibility of the mucous system; it is the same
with regard to the contractility of texture. These two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
properties are besides capable of being put rapidly into
action. We know that the stomach, the intestines, the
bladder, &amp;c. pass in an instant from a great size to extreme
contraction. Their functions even suppose this
rapidity, without which they could not be performed.
The palatine membrane which lines the cheeks, exhibits
the same phenomenon when the mouth is filled with air,
aliments, &amp;c. which are afterwards expelled from it.</p>

<p>When the usual fluids cease to pass through the mucous
ducts, they remain in permanent contraction; this is what
takes place in the intestines below a preternatural anus.
I have seen in this case the cÃ¦cum and the rectum reduced
to the size of a large quill. Yet there is never then
an obliteration of their parietes, on account of the presence
of the mucous juices, of which the patient always passes
a certain quantity. The urethra, after the operations for
stone in which the urine passes for a long time through
the wound, and in the great fistulas in the perineum or
above the pubis, the salivary ducts in wounds which affect
them and through which the whole saliva is discharged,
the nasal canal in fistulÃ¦ lachrymales, contract also more
or less, but are never obliterated. We know that the vas
deferens is often a very long time without having semen
pass through it, and yet it remains open. This phenomenon
distinguishes the mucous ducts from the arterial,
which, when the course of blood is interrupted in them,
change into ligaments in which every thing like a canal
disappears. We ought not to lose sight of this phenomenon
of all the mucous ducts; it proves the incorrectness
of the practice of those who, thinking that at the end of
some time it is impossible to re-establish, in fistulas, the
natural way, think it necessary to make an artificial one.</p>

<p>The mucous tubes are not only not obliterated when
they are empty, but when inflamed they do not even contract
adhesions of their parietes, as so often happens in
the serous cavities, in the cellular texture, &amp;c. Observe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
how important this fact is to the great functions of life;
what would indeed become of these functions, if in
catarrhs of the intestines, the bladder, the stomach, the
Å“sophagus, the excretories, &amp;c. these adhesions were as
frequent as they are in pleurisy, peritonitis, pericarditis,
&amp;c.</p>


<h4>II. <i>Vital Properties.</i></h4>

<p>Few systems live in a more active manner than this;
few exhibit the vital forces in a higher degree.</p>


<h5><i>Properties of Animal Life.</i></h5>

<p>Constantly in relation, like the integuments, with external
bodies, the mucous surfaces have occasion for a
sensibility which would enable the mind to perceive these
relations, especially at the origin of these surfaces. Thus
the animal sensibility is very much developed there. It is
even superior in it in many places to that of the cutaneous
organ, in which no sensation is as acute as those which
take place on the pituitary membrane from odours, upon
the palatine from tastes, upon the surface of the vagina,
the urethra, the glans penis during coition. But without
speaking of these exaggerations of sensibility, if I may so
express myself, all the natural phenomena of the mucous
surfaces prove this property in an evident manner; it is
unnecessary however to pause for these phenomena.</p>

<p>I would only observe that this sensibility, like that of
the cutaneous organ, is essentially subjected to the powerful
influence of habit, which tending constantly to blunt
the acuteness of the sensation of which they are the seat,
brings equally to indifference the pain and the pleasure
they make us experience, and of which it is the medium,
as we know. 1st. I say that habit brings to indifference
the painful sensations arising upon the mucous membranes.
The presence of a sound in the urethra for the first time,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
is distressing the first day, painful the second, inconvenient
the third, and insensible the fourth. Pessaries
introduced into the vagina, bougies into the rectum, tents
fixed in the nasal fossÃ¦, and a canula kept for a length
of time in the nasal canal, exhibit in different degrees the
same phenomena. It is upon this remark that is founded
the possibility of the introduction of sounds into the wind-pipe
to aid respiration, and into the Å“sophagus to produce
an artificial deglutition. This law of habit can even
transform into a pleasure an impression at first painful;
the use of snuff for the pituitary membrane and different
aliments for the palatine, furnish well known examples
of this. 2d. I say that habit brings to indifference
agreeable sensations arising on the mucous surfaces;
the perfumer, placed in an odoriferous atmosphere, the
cook, whose palate is constantly affected by delicious
tastes, do not find in their professions the acute enjoyments
they give to others. From habit can even arise
the succession from pleasure to painful sensations, as in
the preceding case it converts pain to pleasure.</p>

<p>I would however observe that this remarkable influence
of habit is only exerted upon sensations produced by
simple contact, and not upon those produced by real injuries,
as the tearing, the forced stretching, the cutting or
pinching of the mucous system; thus it does not mitigate
the pains caused in the bladder by pressure and by
the tearing a stone occasions, or on the surface of the
womb, of the nasal fossÃ¦, &amp;c. by a polypus, on that of
the Å“sophagus or the wind-pipe by a sharp and uneven
body accidentally lodged there, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>It is to this power of habit over the sensibility of the
mucous system, that must be in part referred the gradual
diminution of its functions, which accompanies age.
Every thing is stimulant in infancy, every thing is blunted
in old age. In one, the very active sensibility of the
alimentary, biliary, urinary, salivary surfaces, &amp;c. con<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>tributes
principally to produce that rapidity with which
the digestive and secretory phenomena succeed each
other; in the other, this sensibility blunted by habitual
contact, connects but slowly the same phenomena.</p>

<p>Is it not from the same cause that arises this remarkable
modification of the sensibility of this system, viz.
that at its origins, as upon the pituitary, the palatine membranes,
the Å“sophagus, the glans penis, the opening of
the rectum, &amp;c. it gives us the sensation of the bodies
with which it is in contact, and that it does not give
this sensation in the very deep organs which it lines,
as in the intestines, the excretories, the gall-bladder,
&amp;c.? In the interior of the organs, this contact is always
uniform; the bladder only knows the contact of the urine,
the gall-bladder that of the bile, the stomach that of the
aliments masticated and reduced, whatever may be their
diversity, to an uniform, pulpy mass. This uniformity
of sensation produces no perception, because in order to
perceive, it is necessary to compare, and here the two
terms of comparison are wanting. Thus the fÅ“tus has
no sensation of the waters of the amnios; thus, the air,
very irritating to a new born infant, becomes insensible
to it. On the contrary, at the beginning of the mucous
membranes, the stimulants vary every instant; the mind
can then perceive the presence of them, because it can
establish approximations between their different modes of
action. What I say is so true, that if in the interior of
the organs, the mucous membranes are in contact with a
foreign body, different from that which they are accustomed
to, they transmit the sensation of it to the mind.
A catheter in the bladder, sounds introduced into the
stomach, &amp;c. are examples of this. Fresh air, in great heat
of the atmosphere, suddenly introduced into the trachea,
carries an agreeable sensation over the whole surface of
the bronchia; but habit soon renders us insensible to it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
and we cease to have the perception of it. Yet it is to
be observed that when the intestines come out in preternatural
inversions of the anus, their sensibility never
becomes so acute as that of the palatine, pituitary surfaces,
&amp;c. &amp;c. The absence of cerebral nerves no doubt
has an influence upon this phenomenon.</p>

<p>The sensibility of the mucous system is much raised
in inflammations; acute catarrhs are, as we know, very
painful. The contact of bodies is then not only felt, but
is very disagreeable. I would observe however that the
sensibility never rises so high as it does in the inflamed
cellular, serous, fibrous systems, &amp;c. A phlegmon, a
pleurisy, &amp;c. compared with a catarrh, are sufficient to
convince us of this. We may say that the organs least
accustomed to feel in the natural state, experience in diseases
the most acute sensations.</p>

<p>There is no animal contractility in the mucous system.</p>


<h5><i>Properties of Organic Life.</i></h5>

<p>Organic sensibility and insensible contractility are very
evident in the mucous system. They are constantly put in
action in it by four different causes; 1st, by the nutrition
of this system; 2d, by the absorption that takes place in
it, either naturally or accidentally; 3d, by its exhalation;
4th, by the constant secretion of its glands. These two
properties are the original causes of all these functions,
the increase and diminution of which are truly the indices
of the state of these glands. As a thousand causes continually
act upon the mucous surfaces, as a thousand different
stimuli continually excite them, especially at their
origin, this state is incessantly varying like the functions
that result from it.</p>

<p>The mucous system differs then from most of the
others; 1st, in this, that the organic sensibility and the
insensible contractility are habitually more exalted in it,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
on account of the more numerous functions over which
they preside; 2d, in this, that they incessantly vary, on
account of the variety of the stimuli. Observe in fact
that, in the osseous, fibrous, cartilaginous, muscular, nervous
systems, &amp;c. on the one hand, these properties are put
in action only by nutrition; and on the other, no stimulant
being in contact with these systems, they always remain
at the same degree.</p>

<p>Hence it is not astonishing that the diseases which especially
put in action the organic sensibility and the insensible
contractility of the same species, should be so frequent
in the mucous organs. All the catarrhal affections, both
acute and chronic, all the hemorrhages, various and
numerous tumours, polypi, fungi, &amp;c. all kinds of excoriations,
ulcers, &amp;c. of which they are the seat, are derived
from the various alterations of which their organic properties
are susceptible.</p>

<p>It is also to these alterations that must be attributed a
remarkable phenomenon, viz. the innumerable varieties
the mucous fluids exhibit in diseases. Take for example
those that are thrown off from the internal surface of the
bronchia, those that are brought up by expectoration, and
which we can examine better than others, because they
are mixed with no foreign substance; observe how they
differ, in the different affections of the chest; sometimes
they have a yellowish and as it were bilious tinge; sometimes
they are frothy in the vessel which receives them;
sometimes they adhere to it with tenacity, and at others
they are easily detached from it. Viscid or liquid, fetid
or without odour, grey, white, green or even black in the
morning, they have a thousand external appearances which
evidently denote differences in their composition, differences
which chemists have not yet explained to us. I
do not speak of the cases where as in phthisis, hemoptysis,
&amp;c. foreign substances are mixed with these mucous
juices. Now it is evident that all these varieties depend<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
only upon the varieties of the organic sensibility of the
bronchial glands or of the membrane upon which they
pour out their fluids. According as the property is differently
altered in the mucous system, it is in relation
with different substances, admits some and rejects others.
The same organ, the same vessels can there, according to
the state of the forces that animate them, separate from
the mass of blood many different substances, rejecting
one to-day and admitting it to-morrow, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Do you wish for other proofs of the innumerable varieties
which the different modifications of the organic sensibility
of the mucous membranes produce in their functions?
Observe the urethra; in the ordinary state it lets
the urine pass freely; in the excitement in which its
forces are in erection, its sensibility repels it and admits
only the semen. Who does not know that in one species
of epiphora, the mucous passages for the tears are open,
and that the diminution only of their vital forces prevents
this fluid from flowing in them? The sensibility of the
mucous surfaces is oftentimes so altered that their glands
refuse to admit every kind of fluid; this happens in the
beginning of some peripneumonies, in which expectoration
is entirely suppressed, it is always a serious beginning,
and even an indication of death, if the state of the
sensibility does not change, unless a relaxation, as it is
commonly called, takes place.</p>

<p>In general, I think that there are but few systems
which deserve, more than this of which we are treating,
to fix the attention of physicians, on account of the innumerable
alterations of which it is susceptible, alterations
which almost always suppose those of the predominant
vital properties of this system, as the alterations of
the muscular, nervous systems, &amp;c. most often put in action
the properties which more particularly belong to
them, viz. animal contractility for one, and the sensibility
of the same species for the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span></p>

<p>The sensible organic contractility does not appear to be
the attribute of the mucous system; yet there is often in
it something more than the insensible oscillations which
compose the other organic contractility. For example, in
the emission of semen, in which there is no agent of impulse
at the extremity of the urethra, as in the evacuation
of urine, it is very probable that this is spasmodically
contracted to produce the jet, oftentimes very strong,
which then takes place. The following phenomenon
which I have observed in myself appears to belong to the
same cause. In gaping, there sometimes escapes from the
mouth then wide open, a small jet of fluid, which coming
from the lateral parts of this cavity that it passes over, is
thrown at some distance; if a surface is then before the
mouth, as when we read a book, this fluid is spread in
small drops upon this surface; it is the saliva which the
excretory duct of Steno throws out with force. Now on
the one hand this duct is almost wholly mucous, and on
the other it has not at its posterior part a muscular agent
of impulse. Perhaps the excretories which pour out their
fluids in the deep parts of the organs, exhibit the same
phenomenon. We know that the milk is also sometimes
subject to a kind of ejection, when it is very abundant,
an ejection which supposes a powerful contraction of the
lactiferous ducts. In general, these different motions
analogous to that of the dartos, of the cellular texture,
&amp;c. appear to hold a middle place between those of tone
and those of irritability.</p>


<h5><i>Sympathies.</i></h5>

<p>There are few systems that sympathize more frequently
with the others than this. Now in its sympathies, it
sometimes influences and sometimes is influenced. The
first Tissot calls the active mode of sympathy, the second
the passive. Let us make use of this classification.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span></p>


<h5><i>Active Sympathies.</i></h5>

<p>One point of the mucous system being inflamed, irritated
or stimulated in any way, all the vital forces can
enter separately into action in the other systems.</p>

<p>Sometimes it is the animal contractility that is brought
sympathetically into action; thus the diaphragm, the intercostal
and abdominal muscles contract to produce sneezing
from irritation of the pituitary membrane, or cough
from the irritation of the membrane of the bronchia, or
from that even of the surface of the stomach, which produces
stomachic coughs, which, as we know, have nothing
to do with affections of the chest. We know the general
spasm that seizes all the muscles the instant a foreign
body passes between the mucous edges of the epiglottis.
Stones of the bladder and the urethra, by making the
cremaster contract sympathetically, produce retraction of
the testicle. Physicians might, I think, profit by the
knowledge of these mucous sympathies. In apoplexy,
in which the bronchia is sometimes filled with mucus
that the patient cannot evacuate, the action of ammonia
upon the pituitary membrane produces the double effect,
1st, of stimulating the brain as blisters do; 2d, of freeing,
by the cough it occasions, the surface of the bronchia,
which being obstructed, is an obstacle to the passage
of the air.</p>

<p>Sometimes it is the animal sensibility that is put into
action by an affection of the mucous surfaces. The stone,
that irritates that of the bladder, causes an itching at the
end of the glans penis. That of the intestines being irritated
by worms, an inconvenient itching is felt at the end
of the nose. Whytt has seen a foreign body introduced
into the ear, affect painfully the whole corresponding side
of the head; an ulcer of the bladder, produce every time
the patient passed water, a pain on the superior part of
the thigh, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span></p>

<p>The sensible organic contractility is often sympathetically
excited by the affections of the mucous system. I
might at first refer to this subject what I have observed
respecting the organic muscles, almost all of which move
from an excitement of a contiguous mucous surface; but
that is a natural phenomenon; there are many others that
are preternatural. A stone that irritates the internal surface
of the pelvis of the kidney produces vomiting, which
is, as we know, produced any time at will by an irritation
of the uvula. The instant the semen passes the
urethra in coition, the action of the heart is commonly
accelerated. Tissot speaks of a stone which, being entangled
in the duct of Warton, produced a sympathetic
discharge from the bowels. I saw at the HÃ´tel Dieu two
women, who, whenever they menstruated, and the mucous
surface of the womb was consequently in activity, could
retain the urine but a short time in the bladder, which
contracted involuntarily to expel it the moment it entered
it. At ordinary times, there was nothing peculiar in
the evacuation of this fluid.</p>

<p>As to the sympathies of insensible contractility and of
organic sensibility, they take place when a mucous surface
being irritated towards the extremity of an excretory
duct, the gland of this duct is brought into action, when,
for example, the saliva flows in greater abundance by the
action of sialagogues upon the extremity of the Stenonian
duct. Whenever there is a gastric derangement and the
mucous surface of the stomach consequently suffers, the
surface of the tongue is sympathetically affected; the
glands situated under this surface increase their action
and hence that white mucous coat, that is commonly called
a foul tongue, which is a real sympathetic catarrh, but
which can however exist idiopathically. Here also is to
be referred the remarkable influence of the mucous system
upon the cutaneous; thus during digestion, in which
the mucous juices pour out abundantly from all sides into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
the stomach and the intestines, and in which the mucous
membranes of the gastric viscera are consequently in
great action, the fluid of insensible transpiration is lessened
remarkably, according to the observation of Sanctorius;
it is in very small quantity three hours after the meal, so
that the action of the cutaneous organ is evidently less
energetic. Thus during sleep, in which all the internal
functions become more evident and are exerted to their
utmost, and in which the sensibility of the mucous membranes
is consequently strongly developed, the skin seems
to be struck with a species of atony; it becomes cold
more easily, it allows less substances to escape from it,
&amp;c. To these sympathies also can be referred many phenomena
of hemorrhages. We know with what facility
the mucous surface ceasing, from any accidental cause, to
throw out blood, as happens so often on that of the womb,
another is immediately affected and discharges this fluid;
hence hemorrhages from the nose, the stomach, the chest,
&amp;c. from the suppression of those of the uterus, &amp;c.</p>


<h5><i>Passive Sympathies.</i></h5>

<p>In many cases, the other systems being irritated, the
animal sensibility of this is brought into action. Among
the numerous examples of this fact, the following is a remarkable
one. In many diseases in which organs foreign
to the mucous system are affected, we experience a sensation
of burning heat in the mouth, the stomach, the intestines,
&amp;c. and yet the mucous surface, the seat of this
sensation, does not disengage more caloric than usual;
we may be convinced of this by placing the fingers in
the mouth. This sensation is of the same nature as that
which we refer to the glans penis when there is a stone
in the bladder, as that which is experienced at the end of
the nose from worms in the intestines, &amp;c. There is no
material cause of pain, and yet there is suffering. Thus
in intermittent fevers we experience a cutaneous shiver<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>ing,
though the skin may be as warm as usual; I would
observe in respect to this, that the mucous membranes are
hardly ever the seat of an analogous sensation of sympathetic
cold, but it is almost always a sensation of heat
that the aberrations of the vital forces produce in them.
Whence arises this difference between them and the
cutaneous organs? I know not. I attribute also to a
sympathy of animal sensibility the great thirst which
takes place in all the severe affections of any part. In
all great wounds, after severe operations, in experiments
on living animals, &amp;c. we observe this thirst which depends
upon a sympathetic affection of the whole mucous
surface that extends into the mouth, the stomach and the
Å“sophagus.</p>

<p>Animal contractility cannot be put sympathetically
into action in the mucous system, since it does not exist
in it.</p>

<p>The same is true of the sensible organic contractility.
It is possible that sometimes the kind of motion we have
noticed, and which resembles this property, may be sympathetically
excited; I know no example of it.</p>

<p>The insensible organic contractility is here very frequently
in sympathetic activity. It is the skin especially
which exercises by means of this property, a great influence
upon the mucous system. 1st. In hemorrhages of
the mucous surface of the womb, the nostrils, &amp;c. a cold
body applied to the skin in the neighbourhood, contracts
this surface and stops the blood. 2d. Who does not
know that the production of most catarrhs is often the
sudden consequence of the action of cold on the cutaneous
organ? 3d. In various affections of the mucous
membranes, baths which relax and expand the skin, frequently
produce happy effects. 4th. When the temperature
of the atmosphere benumbs the cutaneous tone, that
of the mucous system receives a remarkable increase of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
energy. Hence why in winter and in cold climates, in
which the functions of the skin are very much diminished,
all those of this system increase in proportion. Hence
the more evident pulmonary exhalation, the more abundant
internal secretions, a more active digestion, more
quickly performed and consequently an appetite more
easily excited. 5th. When on the contrary the heat of
the climate and the season relax and expand the cutaneous
surface, the mucous surface is in proportion contracted;
in summer, at noon, &amp;c. there is a diminution of the
secretions, of that of the urine especially, a slowness in
the digestive phenomena from a defect in the action of
the stomach and intestines, an appetite slow to return,
&amp;c. 6th. In various general affections of the skin, certain
portions of the mucous membranes are almost always
affected. In scarlet fever, the throat most usually suffers
sympathetically. This phenomenon is very common in
small pox. 7th. In the latter periods of organic affections
of the viscera, as in phthisis, diseases of the heart, enlargements
of the liver, cancers of the womb, &amp;c. the
mucous membranes are affected like the serous surfaces.
The kind of atony in which they then are, produces a
more copious flow of mucous juices in them which are
altered, become more fluid, &amp;c.; hence the diarrhÅ“as
that are called colliquative, which are then to the mucous
surfaces, what dropsies are to the serous ones; 8th. It is
also to this atony that must be attributed the pectoral
hemorrhages which so frequently take place in the last
periods of organic diseases, in those of the heart especially.
During the short time that I have been at the
HÃ´tel Dieu, there has already died more than twenty
patients whom I have opened, of these affections almost
forgotten by all practitioners before the time of Corvisart;
I have only observed four examples in which
passive hemorrhage of the lungs was not the precursor of
death.</p>

<h5><i>Character of the Vital Properties.</i></h5>

<p>From what we have thus far said, it is evident that the
mucous system is one of those of the whole economy, in
which life is the most active. Always in contact with
substances that stimulate and irritate it, it is as it were
like the skin, in continual action. Yet the life is not the
same in all its parts; it undergoes in each remarkable
modifications, which no doubt depend on those we have
pointed out in the organization of this system, in the
nature of its corion, in the arrangement of its papillÃ¦, in
the distribution of its vessels and its nerves, in that of
its glands, &amp;c.; for as we have seen, none of these essential
bases of the mucous system is everywhere arranged
in the same manner. There is an organization common
to the system, and one peculiar to each of its divisions.
It is the same in regard to its life; there is a life common
to the system, and as many peculiar ones as there
are parts to which it is extended. We know how much
the animal sensibility of the pituitary membrane differs
from that of the palatine, how powerfully the membrane
of the glans penis and the urethra is stimulated by the
passage of the semen which makes no impression upon
any other mucous surface. The same is true in regard to
the organic sensibility and the contractility of the same
species. Each mucous surface, in relation with the fluid
it is accustomed to, would bear the others with difficulty.
The urine would be a stimulant for the stomach and the
gastric juice for the bladder; the bile that remains in the
gall-bladder would produce a catarrh upon the membrane
of the nose, in the vesiculÃ¦ seminales, &amp;c.</p>

<p>From these varieties in the vital forces of each division
of the mucous system, it is not astonishing that the diseases
of this system should also be very variable. Each
has a general character, but this is modified in each mucous
surface. There is an order of symptoms common<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
to all catarrhs; but each has its peculiar signs, each has
its different products. The fluid from a pulmonary
catarrh does not resemble that from a nasal one; that
coming from a urethral, vesical catarrh, &amp;c. is wholly different
from that from an intestinal one. These fluids
exhibit in their morbid changes the same differences that
we have pointed out in their natural composition, differences
which are derived like them, from the different
vitality of each portion of the mucous system.</p>

<p>It is to these varieties of life and the vital forces that
must be referred also those of the sympathies. Each
portion of this system has a peculiar sympathetic action
upon the other organs. The pituitary alone being irritated
produces sneezing. You would excite in vain the
extremity of the glans penis, the rectum, &amp;c. you would
never produce vomiting as you do by stimulating the
uvula.</p>

<p>An important remark should here be made in regard
to the stomach. We know that there is no organ which
performs a more important part in the sympathies than
this. The least affection of this important viscus, the
least gastric derangement, spread over the whole animal
economy a painful influence; all the other parts feel it.
I do not believe even that there is any uneasiness more
fatiguing and general than that which we then experience
in certain cases. The general weakness which takes
place in hunger almost instantaneously, is sympathetic;
the alteration of nutrition has not had time to produce it.
The same is true with regard to the sudden increase of
the forces which results from the contact of the aliments
upon the mucous surface of this viscus, an increase which
cannot be attributed to the passage of the chyle into the
blood, which has not yet had time to take place.</p>

<p>I think the stomach owes this important part in the
sympathies principally to its mucous surface. In fact,
1st, its serous surface has no connexion with it, since it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
there of the same nature as in all the rest of the peritoneum,
besides in what is called inflammation of the abdomen,
and in which this serous surface is especially affected,
we do not observe such numerous sympathetic relations.
2d. The fleshy coat appears to be the same as that
of the whole intestinal canal; why then should it have
different influences? 3d. As it respects blood-vessels and
nerves of the ganglions, the stomach is nearly organized
like the rest of the alimentary tube. 4th. It has besides
the par vagum; but is this nerve alone capable of producing
such numerous phenomena? It can contribute to them;
but certainly the peculiar modifications which it experiences
in the mucous surface, the peculiar nature of this
membrane contribute also much to it. No membrane is
organized like that of the stomach. Though we do not
see perfectly at first view its organic differences, reflection
is sufficient to convince us of them; thus on the one hand
no one separates so great a quantity of fluid, and on the
other none furnishes one of a nature analogous to that of
the gastric juice.</p>

<h3>ARTICLE FOURTH.<br />

<small>DEVELOPMENT OF THE MUCOUS SYSTEM.</small></h3>


<h4>I. <i>State of the Mucous System in the First Age.</i></h4>

<p>The development of the mucous system follows in
general the laws of that of the organs to which it belongs.
Early in the gastric apparatus, later in the pulmonary and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
that of generation, it seems in its growth rather to obey
the impulse it receives, than to give one to what surrounds
it, an arrangement common to almost all the systems
which contribute to form the different apparatus.
Observe in fact that there is always in the growth certain
parts to which all the others refer; thus in the cerebral
apparatus, the early size of the brain produces that of the
bones of the cranium, of the dura-mater, the pia-mater,
the arachnoides and the vessels; thus it is on account of
the spinal marrow, that the vertebral canal is so evident
in the fÅ“tus; thus all the serous surfaces have a growth in
proportion to that of their respective organs, &amp;c. &amp;c. I
would remark however that the early growth of the systems
which are only to follow that of the parts to which
they are destined, is only in the dimensions of length,
breadth, &amp;c. The thickness most commonly does not
correspond with these dimensions. Thus the bones of
the cranium though broader in proportion than those
of the pelvis in the fÅ“tus, are not thicker. The extent of
the dura-mater is in proportion greater than that of the
albuginea which belongs to the same system; but the
organization is no further advanced.</p>

<p>In the fÅ“tus, the delicacy of the mucous texture is extreme,
the papillÃ¦ are hardly perceptible. But by carrying
the hand over a mucous surface, we feel there an
extremely delicate velvet and such as is not equalled by
the finest velvet. The redness of this system is not then
as evident, because no doubt less blood penetrates it, as
the various functions which are afterwards to take place
upon these surfaces, as digestion, the excretions, respiration,
&amp;c. are but feeble or entirely wanting. At this
age, the quantity of blood seems to be in an inverse ratio
in the skin and in these surfaces. The mucous red is
then like the muscular, of a very deep tinge, often even
livid, on account of the nature of the blood circulating in
the arteries. Then the adhesions of the mucous texture to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
the subjacent cellular are less; those especially of this
last with the surrounding parts are very slight; thus it is
very easy to draw out whole the internal portion of the
intestines of the fÅ“tus, from the external covering that
contains it, so as to see two cylindrical canals, one of
which is muscular and serous, the other cellular and mucous.
The stretching destroys in this experiment all the
valvulÃ¦ conniventes, and the small intestines are as smooth
on the interior as the large, in the canal artificially extracted.
If we subject this canal to ebullition, much
more scum arises from it than in the adult; this scum is
white and never green. The crisping that takes place a
little before the first boiling, diminishes more in proportion
the length of the canal, and consequently appears to
be stronger.</p>

<p>At birth, when respiration and digestion suddenly commence,
the secretions increase, the mucous system acquires
a remarkable degree of activity. It is instantly
excited powerfully by the many new substances with
which it is in contact. It is by it and by the cutaneous
system that bodies foreign to ours then immediately stimulate
it, and so much the more efficaciously, as the double
surface which receives the excitement is not accustomed
to it. Then the red blood which penetrates the mucous
system, gives it an increase of energy and sensibility,
which renders it still more proper to receive impressions.
Thus the mucous juices which till then stagnated upon
their respective surfaces, without fatiguing and irritating
them, are suddenly for them, on account of their increase
of sensibility, stimulants which excite them, and force
the subjacent muscles to contract. Then the urine becomes
for the bladder a cause that promotes the contraction
of it. A few instants after birth, all the openings
in which the mucous membranes begin, open and permit
to escape the meconium, the urine and all the mucous
juices. This internal and general shock that empties all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
the mucous cavities, renders them fit to become the seat
of the great functions which are soon to take place in
them.</p>

<p>When all the internal functions are in activity, the mucous
surfaces experience no more sudden changes, analogous
to that of which I have spoken. They grow like
the other viscera in a slow and insensible manner; they
preserve for a long time their original softness, which is
remarkable, especially in the nose, the stomach, &amp;c. and
which during lactation, is not adapted in the infant, to
the solid substances with which the adult is nourished.
Is this softness the cause of the mucous affections which
are in general so common at that age? We know that
then the mucous juices abound; the pituitary membrane
is more moist; the stomach and intestines are frequently
affected with a species of catarrh which is the cause of
the looseness that we have so often to combat in infancy.
The membrane of the bronchia is also frequently diseased.
The two extreme ages of life resemble each other by the
abundance of the mucous juices secreted upon their respective
mucous surfaces.</p>

<p>In youth the mucous system is in very powerful action.
The active hemorrhages of this system are very frequent
at this age; those of the nose, the bronchia and even the
stomach often take place; those of the portions of this
system, subjacent to the diaphragm, are then less common.
Observe that in man, hemorrhages of the gastro-pulmonary
surface are infinitely more frequent than those
of the genito-urinary surface, which on the contrary, are
much more numerous in woman in whom one of them is
natural to a part of this surface, viz. menstruation.</p>

<p>At the period of puberty, the development of the
genital parts in both sexes, gives much activity to a part
of the genito-urinary surface; then menstruation begins
upon that of the womb; then the sensibility of the
urethra is raised in order to feel acutely the passage of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
the semen. Observe that this increase of energy is not
attended with a weakness of the other parts, as happens
in many cases; on the contrary, all the systems, all the
apparatus seem to borrow, from the force which the genital
parts acquire, an increase of action.</p>


<h4>II. <i>State of the Mucous System in the subsequent
Ages.</i></h4>

<p>In the years which succeed youth, the mucous system
continues to grow, thicken and become firmer. Its vital
energy seems still to predominate for some time, in the
superior surfaces, as in the pituitary, the membrane of
the bronchia, &amp;c.; thus the affections of these parts are
more frequent until the thirtieth year. But as we advance
in age, the abdominal mucous surfaces appear to
predominate over the others, as in general all the organs
of this region do.</p>

<p>Besides, a thousand causes in the course of life, make
the state of the mucous system vary. We do not find it
in two subjects, with the same shade of colour, with the
same density, with the same external appearance. By
taking any surface upon many subjects, that of the stomach,
for example, we easily see these differences, with which
we must be struck if we have opened dead bodies but
ever so little.</p>

<p>The redness of the mucous texture is very bright until
the thirtieth year; after that, it begins to alter. This texture
becomes more and more pale in old age; the blood
enters it but in small quantity; it acquires more consistence
and density. The fingers carried over it no longer
perceive that softness, that velvet so remarkable in the
first age. Its forces, which grow languid, render difficult,
in the excretories, the exit of the fluids which pass
through these tubes to be thrown out. Yet the mucous
glands still secrete their fluids in very great abundance.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
Often even these fluids increase in proportion which constitutes
the catarrhal affections, so common in old age.
But these affections then have the same character as the
functions of the whole system; secretion takes place
slowly; the disease is always chronic; most often it terminates
only with life.</p>

<p>The mucous absorption is, at this age, slow and difficult,
like all the others; the various contagions are taken
much less easily, either by the respiratory surfaces, or by
the contact of contagious miasmata upon the neighbouring
surfaces of the skin. The chyle slowly absorbed,
makes the digestive periods longer.</p>

<h2 id="SEROUS_SYSTEM">SEROUS SYSTEM.</h2>


<p>This system, the name of which I borrow, like that
of the preceding, from the fluid that constantly lubricates
one of its surfaces, is always like it arranged in the form
of membranes, and never in fasciculi like the muscular
system, or in round bodies like the glandular. It is formed
by the peritoneum, the pleura, the pericardium, the
arachnoides, the tunica vaginalis, &amp;c. The term serous
membrane will then be very often used to designate it.
No one, I believe, before the publication of my Treatise
on the Membranes, had considered in a general manner
these organs, which perform a less important part in the
functions than the mucous, but which in diseases are
almost as frequently affected. Pinel, who has perceived
the analogy of their inflammations, has taken this system
as a character of one of the classes of his phlegmasiÃ¦.</p>


<hr class="chap" />

<h3>ARTICLE FIRST.<br />

<small>OF THE EXTENT, FORMS, AND FLUIDS OF THE SEROUS
SYSTEM.</small></h3>

<p>The serous system occupies the exterior of most of
the organs of which the mucous lines the interior; such
are the stomach, the intestines, the bladder, the lungs,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
&amp;c. We see it around all those that are essential to life,
as around the brain, the heart, all the gastric viscera, the
testicles, the bladder, &amp;c. It does not form, like the mucous
system, a surface everywhere continuous upon the
numerous organs on which it is spread. But it is always
found insulated in its different divisions which never
have any communication. The number of these divisions
is somewhat considerable. By considering in one
view all the different serous surfaces, we see that as a
whole they exceed the mucous surfaces viewed also in
a general manner. One consideration is sufficient to
convince us of it. The mucous and serous surfaces accompany
each other in a very great number of parts,
as in the stomach, the intestines, the lungs, the bladder,
the gall-bladder, &amp;c. so as to exhibit in them nearly the
same extent. But on the one hand, the mucous surfaces
extend where the serous are not met with, as in the nasal
fossÃ¦, the Å“sophagus, the mouth, &amp;c. &amp;c.; and on the
other, there is a very great number of serous surfaces
existing separately from the mucous, as the pericardium,
the arachnoides, &amp;c. Now if we compare the extent of
the separate serous surfaces, with that of the separate
mucous surfaces, we shall see that the first is much greater
than the other.</p>

<p>These considerations, apparently minute, deserve however
particular attention, on account of the relation of
functions existing between these two surfaces taken as a
whole, a relation which is especially connected with the
exhalation of the albuminous fluids produced by one,
and with the secretion of the mucous fluids, of which
the other is the seat. Besides, in examining the extent
of each serous membrane in particular, we see great
varieties from the peritoneum which has the greatest surface,
to the tunica vaginalis which has the least.</p>

<p>The serous surface taken as a whole, compared with
the cutaneous surface, is also evidently superior to it in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
extent; so that in this respect, the quantity of albuminous
fluids constantly exhaled within, appears to be much
more considerable than that of the fluid which is incessantly
thrown off by insensible transpiration; I say in
this respect, for different circumstances, by increasing the
action of the cutaneous organ, can re-establish the equilibrium
in the exhalation of these two fluids, one of which
re-enters by absorption into the circulation, and the other
is wholly excrementitious. I do not know even if the
pulmonary and cutaneous exhalations united are not less
than those which take place upon the serous surfaces.</p>

<p>Every serous membrane represents a sac without an
opening, spread upon the respective organs that it embraces,
and which are sometimes very numerous, as in
the case of the peritoneum, sometimes single, as in the
case of the pericardium, covering these organs so that
they are not contained in its cavity, and so that if it was
possible to dissect them from their surface, we should
have this cavity whole. This sac has in this respect the
same arrangement as those night caps, which are folded
within themselves; a trifling comparison, but which gives
an accurate idea of this sort of membranes.</p>

<p>From this general arrangement, it is easy to understand
that the serous membranes are never opened to
permit the vessels and nerves to penetrate the respective
organs to which they go or from which they come off,
but that they always wind round them and accompany
them to the organ, and thus form for them a sheath which
prevents them from being contained in their cavities;
this removes the danger of infiltration of serum which
lubricates them, an infiltration which would take place
through the neighbouring cellular texture, especially if
they were dropsical; if, as in the fibrous membranes, they
were pierced with foramina for the passage of these vessels
and nerves. This arrangement, exclusively remarkable
in the membranes of which we are treating, and in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
the synovial ones, is evident at the entrance of the vessels
of the lungs, the spleen, the intestines, the stomach,
the testicles, &amp;c. We see it very well in the arachnoides,
a membrane essentially serous, as I have demonstrated
elsewhere.</p>

<p>From the general idea that we have given of these
membranes, it is also easy to understand how almost all
are composed of two distinct parts, though continuous,
and embracing, the one the internal surface of the cavity
where they are found, the other the organs of this cavity;
thus there is a costal and pulmonary pleura, a cranial and
cerebral arachnoides, one portion of peritoneum spread
upon the gastric organs, and another upon the abdominal
parietes, a free portion of the pericardium, and one adhering
to the heart. The same arrangement exists in the
testicles, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Though the serous membranes may be separate, yet
there sometimes exists communications between them;
that for example of the cavity of the omentum with that
of the peritoneum, that of the cavity of the arachnoides
with the cavity of the membrane which lines the ventricles
by the canal that I have discovered, and the external
orifice of which is seen below and at the posterior part
of the corpus callosum; whilst the internal one is seen
above the pineal gland, between the two rows of small
round bodies which are usually found in this place.</p>

<p>There is but one example of continuity between the
serous and mucous membranes, that which exists, by
means of the Fallopian tube, between the peritoneum
and the uterine surface. How does the respective nature
of the two membranes change here?</p>


<h5><i>Free Surface of the Serous Membranes.</i></h5>

<p>Every serous membrane has one of its two surfaces
free, everywhere contiguous to itself, and the other adhering
to the neighbouring organs. The first is remarkable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
for its polish, which especially distinguishes this system
and the following, from all the other membranes. All the
organs which exhibit this arrangement owe it to the covering
they borrow from it. The liver ceases to be smooth
and shining at its diaphragmatic edge where the peritoneum
abandons it. There is in this respect a great difference
in the appearance of the anterior and posterior
face of the cÃ¦cum. The bladder is rough wherever the
peritoneal covering is wanting. The cartilages of the
ribs have not the polish of those of the articulations which
the synovial membrane covers.</p>

<p>Does this remarkable attribute of the serous membranes
depend on the compression exerted upon them? Their
situation in places where they are exposed to continual
friction, would seem to make it probable. Bordeu thought
so, when he said that all the parts of the abdomen are originally
covered with cellular texture, which by pressure is
afterwards changed into membranes; so that the peritoneum
is formed partially upon each gastric organ, and its
different parts give birth, by uniting, to the general membrane.
This explanation of the formation of the peritoneum
is applicable, according to him, to the pleura, the
pericardium, and all the analogous membranes. But if this
is the progress of nature, 1st, why, whatever be the period
at which we examine the fÅ“tus, do we find the peritoneum
and the serous membranes as much developed in
proportion, as their corresponding organs? 2d. How are
the numerous folds of these membranes formed, such as
the mesentery, the omentum, &amp;c.? 3d. Why are there
parts where they do not exist though they are exposed
to as great friction as that of the parts where they are
found? Why, for example, are the sides of the bladder
destitute of it, whilst it covers its superior part? 4th.
Why does it not also form serous surfaces around the
great vessels of the arm, the thigh, &amp;c. which impart to
the neighbouring organs an evident motion? 5th. Why<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
does not the thickness of the serous membranes increase
where the motion is strongest and diminish where it is
weakest? Why for example does the thickness of the
tunica vaginalis equal that of the pericardium? 6th.
How can friction internally produce an organized body,
whilst externally it constantly disorganizes the epidermis?
7th. How can we associate the vascular lymphatic
texture of the serous membranes with the pressure that
produces them? The impossibility of resolving these
numerous questions proves, that it is not to mechanical
pressure that must be attributed the formation of the
serous membranes and the polish of their surface; that
their mode of origin is the same as that of the other
organs; that they commence and are developed with
them; that this polish is an evident result of their organization,
as the mucous papillÃ¦ depend upon the texture of
the surfaces to which they belong. What would be said
of a system in which these papillÃ¦ should be attributed
to the pressure of the aliments upon the stomach, of the
urine on the bladder, the air on the pituitary membrane,
&amp;c.?</p>

<p>The free surface of the serous membranes separates
entirely from the neighbouring organs those upon which
these membranes are spread; so that they are to these
organs real boundaries, barriers, if I may use the term,
or integuments, if it should be preferred, very different
however from those which are external. Observe in fact
that all the principal viscera, the heart, the lungs, the
brain, the gastric viscera, the testicles, &amp;c. limited by their
serous covering, suspended in the middle of the sac that
it forms, only communicate with the adjacent parts where
their vessels enter; everywhere else there is contiguity
and not continuity.</p>

<p>This insulation of position coincides very well with
the insulation of vitality which is remarked in all the
organs, and especially in those that we have just noticed.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
Each has its peculiar life, which is the result of a particular
modification of its vital forces, a modification which
necessarily establishes one in the circulation, nutrition
and temperature. No part feels, is moved and nourished
like another, unless it belongs to the same system. Each
organ executes on a small scale the phenomena which
take place on a large one in the economy; each takes
from the circulation the aliment that is proper for it,
digests it, throws back into the mass of blood, the portion
which is heterogeneous to it, and appropriates to itself
that which can nourish it; it is digestion in miniature.
No doubt the ancients wished to give an idea of this
truth which has been so well explained by Bordeu, when
they said that the womb was a living animal within
another. A very important use then of the serous membranes
is to contribute, by rendering independent the
position of their respective organs, to the independence
of the vital forces, life and functions of these organs.</p>

<p>Let us not forget to consider under the same point of
view, the moist atmosphere with which they are constantly
surrounded, an atmosphere analogous to that which
the cellular texture forms for various other organs. In
this atmosphere all the morbific emanations of the organ
go and are lost, if we may so say, without these emanations
injuring the other organs. We have seen that this
atmosphere in the cellular system is sometimes the seat
of phenomena wholly different, and serves to transmit
diseases from one organ to another. Now the serous
membranes are a barrier much less easily surmounted,
because they have not filaments which go from one organ
to another, there is only contiguity as I have said, with
the organs that they surround. We very rarely see in
the abdomen a disease of the liver communicated to the
intestines, one of the spleen passing to the stomach, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The smoothness of the free surface of the serous system
greatly facilitates the motions of the organs which it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
covers. We have already observed that nature employs
two principal means for this object, viz. the membranes
and the cellular texture. By distributing externally the
second of these means, it has designed the first especially
for internal motions. The smoothness and moisture of
the serous surfaces are singularly favourable for them.
These internal motions are usually regarded only in an
insulated manner, as relating to the functions of the organ
that executes them, as in relation to the circulation for
the heart, respiration for the lungs, digestion for the
stomach, &amp;c. But they should also be considered in a
general manner; they should be regarded as carrying
through the whole machine a continual excitement which
supports and animates the forces and the action of all the
organs of the head, the chest and the abdomen, which
receive less sensibly than the organs of the extremities,
the influence of external motions. It is these internal
motions that excite, sustain, and develop within, the nutritive
phenomena, as the motions of the thigh, the arm, &amp;c.
without, favour the nutrition of the muscles which are
found there; this is seen very evidently in bakers and
other mechanics who exert more particularly this or that
part. It is thus that the serous membranes contribute
indirectly to the nutrition and growth of their respective
viscera; but they never have a direct influence upon this
nutrition, because their organization and life are different
from the life and organization of these viscera.</p>

<p>The free surface of the serous system differs essentially
from that of the mucous, in this, that it contracts frequent
adhesions. The pleura is of all the serous organs,
that in which these adhesions are the most evident. We
find almost as many dead bodies in which they exist, as
we do those in which they do not. Next to the pleura
is the peritoneum, then the pericardium, then the tunica
vaginalis, then the arachnoides, which is that of all the
serous surfaces in which adhesions are the least frequent,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
though I have observed them in it. These adhesions
exhibit many varieties which can be studied best on the
pleura, which are as follows.</p>

<p>1st. Sometimes the costal and pulmonary portion are
so identified at many points or in every part, that they
make but a single membrane, and are united as closely
as the two edges of the lip in a hare-lip that has been
operated upon with success. 2d. At other times the adhesion
is so slight, that the least effort is sufficient to
destroy it. I have many times noticed this fact in the
pericardium. I saw it once in the tunica vaginalis of a
man who had been operated upon for hydrocele by means
of injection, at the time I was surgeon for operations at
the HÃ´tel Dieu. Separated then from each other, the two
surfaces were uneven; they lost their polish. 3d. Frequently
between the costal and pulmonary portion of the
pleura, between the surfaces of the peritoneum, &amp;c. there
are several elongations of various lengths, which form a
kind of loose bridles, traversing the serous cavity, having
the same organization and polish as the membrane of
which they appear a kind of fold, containing in their
interior a species of small canal, because they are formed
by two layers united together, resembling very much the
elongation of the synovial membrane of the knee, which
goes from the posterior part of the patella to the space
between the condyles of the femur, having also an appearance
analogous to the different natural folds of the peritoneum.
We can hardly conceive that these filaments so
regularly organized can result from inflammation. I am
inclined to believe that they are owing to an original conformation.
4th. Frequently between the two portions of
the pleura, there are seen many other elongations wholly
different, which are not smooth, and do not form canals,
but which appear to be flocculent and really analogous to
the cellular layers; so that where they exist it may be
said, that the membrane is entirely changed into this tex<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>ture,
which is besides, as we shall see, the essential base
of its organization. 5th. I do not speak of the adhesions
produced by false membranes, by albuminous flakes, intermediate
to the two portions of a serous surface, &amp;c. These
adhesions are to a certain point foreign to these surfaces.</p>


<h4>II. <i>Adherent Surface of the Serous System.</i></h4>

<p>The external surface of the serous membranes adheres
almost everywhere to the neighbouring organs; it is rare
in fact to see these membranes detached on both sides.
The arachnoides at the basis of the cranium, and some
other examples are exceptions. This adhesion of the
serous membranes to their respective organs, is wholly
different from that of the fibrous membranes. In this
last, the passage of the vessels so unites the two parts,
that their organization, seems to be common, and when
one is removed, the other almost always dies, as is seen
in the periosteum in relation to the bones, &amp;c. On the
contrary, every serous membrane is almost foreign to the
organ it surrounds; their organization is different. The
following are proofs of it;</p>

<p>1st. We very often see these membranes abandon and
cover again successively their respective organs; thus
the broad ligaments, at a great distance from the womb
in the ordinary state, are to it like a serous membrane
during pregnancy. An intestine when distended borrows
from the mesentery a covering that quits it when it contracts.
The omentum is by turns, as Chaussier has well
observed, a loose membrane in the abdomen and a covering
of the stomach. The peritoneal envelope of the
bladder often leaves it almost entirely. Has not the hernial
sac of those enormous tumours of gastric viscera
originally served to line the parietes of the abdomen?
Now it is evident, since the different organs can exist
separate from their serous membranes, that there is no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
connexion between their organization. 2d. It is always a
loose texture, easily stretched in every direction, that
serves as a means of union, and never a sanguineous vascular
system, as in most of the other adhesions. 3d.
The affection of an organ is not a necessary consequence
of that of its serous membrane, and reciprocally the organ
is often affected and the membrane does not become diseased.
For example, in the operation for hydrocele, the
testicle remains almost always sound in the midst of the
inflammation of its tunica vaginalis. The inflammation
of the mucous membrane of the intestines is not a consequence
of that of their peritoneal covering; and reciprocally
in the various acute catarrhal affections of the organs
with a mucous membrane within and a serous one without,
this last is never found inflamed. In a word, the
affections of the mucous membranes are everywhere very
distinct from those of the serous, though most commonly
both contribute to the formation of the same organ. It
is evident that a line of demarcation so great in the affections
supposes one of course in the organization. The
life of the serous membranes then is entirely distinct
from that of their corresponding organs.</p>

<p>Yet there are cases where these membranes do not present
this loose adhesion, and where they become so united
to the organs which they line, that frequently the most
delicate scalpel cannot separate them. Observe the tunica
vaginalis on the albuginea, the arachnoides on the dura-mater,
and other membranes which form what I have
called the sero-fibrous, &amp;c.; such is the connexion of
these different surfaces, that many have been mistaken to
the present time for a single membrane. There is however
no more identity in the organization, than where the
serous membranes are more loosely attached to their respective
organs, as is seen in the peritoneum, the pleura,
&amp;c. Diseases sometimes make this difference very evident.
I have seen the arachnoides in a subject that had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
been affected with a chronic inflammation, evidently thickened
on the internal surface of the dura-mater, without
this having experienced the slightest alteration; it was
detached without difficulty and torn with great ease.</p>


<h4>III. <i>Serous Fluids.</i></h4>

<p>Every serous membrane is moistened on its internal
surface by a fluid almost the same as the serum of the
blood. The exhaling orifices constantly pour it out and
it is constantly taken up by the absorbents. Its quantity
varies. A mere dew in the natural state, it is exhaled in
vapour when the serous surfaces are laid bare and allow
the air to dissolve it. It is in general more abundant in
dead bodies than in the living, because on the one hand
the transudation which the tonic forces prevent, then
easily takes place from the destruction of these forces,
and supplies the place of the vital exhalation, by transmitting
mechanically by their weight, the fluids of the
surrounding organs to the different serous cavities, and
because on the other hand, this destruction of the tonic
forces prevents every kind of absorption; hence the
stagnation and accumulation of this fluid. We know to
what an extent this increases in various dropsies, especially
in that of the abdomen.</p>

<p>Does this quantity vary according to the different states
of the organs which the serous membranes cover? It
has been long said, that the synovia is exhaled in greater
abundance in the motion of the articulations, than in their
state of rest. I have no data on this point founded upon
experiment; but I am certain that I have many times observed
in living animals, that the exhalation of the serous
surface of the abdomen does not increase during digestion,
or at least if it is greater, absorption becomes more
active, and thus the surface of the peritoneum is not more
moist than at another time. I have opened the thorax of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
many small guinea-pigs, after having first made them run
a long time in the chamber in order to accelerate their
respiration, and I have not observed greater moisture on
the pleura. Yet it cannot be doubted, as we shall see,
that the quantity of the serous fluids may be very variable
in the different acute diseases; that the serous membranes
exhale more or less of them, according to the manner in
which they are sympathetically affected.</p>

<p>In the first periods of inflammations, in which the exhalants
of the serous membranes are full of blood which
is preternaturally introduced into them, the serum does
not ooze in greater quantity from their free surface. Then
as they are on the one hand very sensible, and very dry
on the other, the motions of the organs that they cover
are wonderfully painful. It is in these first periods that
adhesions take place. If they are not formed either on
account of the motion, or for other reasons, and if resolution
of the inflammation does not take place, then happens
to the serous surfaces what happens to a wound not
united; they suppurate, but this suppuration is never attended
with ulceration or erosion of their substance.
However abundant the purulent collections may be, these
membranes always remain sound; their texture is only
more or less thickened; pus is thrown out by them, like
the natural serous fluids, that is by exhalation. We know
how much this fluid varies in consistence from milky
serum, to the thickest false membrane that adheres
strongly to the surface that has exhaled the materials of it.</p>

<p>The nature of the fluids of the serous system is very
evidently albuminous. The instant one of the membranes
of this system is plunged into boiling water, I
have observed that it is covered with a white layer which
is concrete albumen, and which being removed some
time after, leaves the surface nearly of its original colour.
All the substances which coagulate albumen produce
a similar layer upon the serous surfaces. The ex<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>periments
of Hewson, who has collected some spoonsful
of these fluids in the great animals, confirm their albuminous
nature. Rouelle and Fourcroy who have analyzed
the water of dropsies have also found albumen predominant
in it. Observe upon this subject that all the white
flakes swimming in this water, that the false membranes
that form in it and the white fluids which give it the appearance
of milk, appear to be only albumen which is
found in different degrees of consistence. It might be
said that the heat of inflammation has produced the same
phenomenon during life, that common caloric does upon
the white of an egg, the water of dropsies, &amp;c. I shall
not treat of the other accessory principles that enter into
the composition of the serous fluids.</p>


<hr class="chap" />

<h3>ARTICLE SECOND.<br />

<small>ORGANIZATION OF THE SEROUS SYSTEM.</small></h3>

<p>The first characters of the structure of these membranes
are a white, shining colour, less brilliant than that
of the aponeuroses; a variable thickness, very evident
upon the liver, the heart, the intestines, &amp;c. hardly discoverable
upon the arachnoides, the omentum, &amp;c.; a remarkable
transparency whenever these membranes are
raised for a considerable extent, or are examined where
they are detached on both sides, as on the omentum.</p>

<p>All have but a single layer which it is possible, at the
places where it is thick, to raise from the cellular layers,
but which can never be neatly divided into two or three
portions; a character essentially distinct from those of
the mucous membranes. The action of a blister on their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
external surface first laid bare, for example, on a portion
of intestine drawn out in a living animal, does not make
a pellicle rise upon it, as upon the skin, a pellicle under
which the serum is collected. I have frequently made
this attempt. What is the immediate structure of this
single layer of the serous membranes? I shall now examine
it.</p>


<h4>I. <i>Cellular Nature of the Serous Texture.</i></h4>

<p>Every system is in general, as we have thus far seen,
an assemblage, 1st. of common parts, which are especially
the cellular texture, the blood vessels, the exhalants, the
absorbents and the nerves, which form as we have said
the outline and the frame of it, if I may so express myself;
2d. of a peculiar fibre formed by a substance which
is deposited in this outline, by gelatine, for example, for
the cartilages, by gelatine and phosphate of lime for the
bones, by fibrin for the muscles, &amp;c. That which makes
these organs resemble each other then is the cellular
organ, the vessels and the nerves; that which distinguishes
them, is their peculiar texture, which depends
itself upon a peculiar nutritive matter. A bone would
become a muscle, if, without changing its texture at all,
nature had imparted to it the faculty of secreting fibrin,
and of encrusting itself with it, instead of separating the
phosphate of lime and being penetrated with it. But
the serous system does not appear to have in it a distinct
nutritive matter, and consequently a peculiar texture. It
is only formed of the mould, the outline of others, and
is not penetrated by a substance that characterizes it.
Almost wholly cellular, it does not differ from this system
in its common form, except by a degree of condensation,
by an approximation and union of cells which are
found scattered in the ordinary state.</p>

<p>The following are the proofs that the texture of the
serous system is wholly cellular. 1st. There is an iden<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>tity
of nature where there is an identity of functions and
diseases; now it is evident that the uses of these membranes
and of the cellular texture, as it respects the continual
absorption and exhalation of lymph are completely
the same, and that the phenomena of the various dropsies
are common to them, with the difference only of the
effusion in the one and infiltration in the other. 2d. The
inflation of air into the texture subjacent to these membranes
terminates by bringing them almost to a cellular
state, when it succeeds and is pushed for some time; an
experiment which is frequently very difficult. 3d. Maceration,
as has been remarked by Haller, produces at length
the same effect, but in a still more evident manner. 4th.
The various cysts, hydatids, &amp;c. whose appearance, texture
and nature even are entirely the same as in the serous
membranes, as we have seen, always arise in the midst
of the cellular texture, grow at its expense and are wholly
formed of it. 5th. No fibre is found in the serous membranes;
a character that distinguishes it from all the other
organs and analogous to that of the cellular texture.</p>

<p>To these various proofs of analogy, of identity even of
the cellular and serous systems, we can add the action of
different reagents, which give results precisely similar in
both. 1st. Every serous membrane when dried, becomes
transparent, does not turn yellow like the fibrous and
the mucous membranes, preserves a pliability foreign to
these membranes when dried, and gradually resumes
its original state when it is immersed in water. 2d. It
becomes putrid much slower than the mucous surfaces,
the muscular layers, the glands, &amp;c. This is remarkable
in the abdomen, upon the peritoneum which is frequently
almost untouched, when every thing is putrid around it,
as may be seen by removing it; for its transparency
would make you believe at first view that it was altered,
if you examine it upon the fleshy and mucous surfaces.
3d. Maceration at the ordinary temperature of cellars, re<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>duces
with great difficulty to a pulp the serous membranes.
The omentum, the finest and most delicate of
these membranes has resisted it for a very long time in
my experiments. This phenomenon is particularly striking
when compared with the maceration of tendons which
are so resisting, and which support such great efforts
during life. These become pulpy in water before the
omentum is touched. The same phenomenon takes place
with regard to all the other serous surfaces. 4th. In boiling
water, these surfaces acquire the horny hardness like
the fibrous system, but furnish infinitely less gelatine;
they do not become yellow like it. The pleura in those
portions of the thorax of animals that are brought to our
tables, has almost its ordinary appearance; only it is less
shining, has lost the faculty of crisping from the action
of caloric, is no longer affected in the same way by acids,
&amp;c. If it was of a fibrous nature it would have disappeared
in gelatine, on account of its delicacy. I shall
say the same of the external membrane of the spleen, the
liver and the lungs. Compare these membranes, that are
brought to our tables, when boiled with the intermuscular
aponeuroses, the tendons, &amp;c. you will see that it is
impossible to confound, as has been done, all the white
textures together, in regard to their nature.</p>

<p>If we compare the different effects of agents the most
known upon the serous system, with those that we have
observed upon the cellular system, we shall see that they
are entirely the same; that these two systems are consequently
analogous, and even identical.</p>

<p>The serous system when it putrefies in the open air
does not become green like the skin, but is of a dull and
very deep grey. During life, on the contrary, its blackness
is very evident in gangrene which is sometimes the
result of an acute inflammation, sometimes of those chronic
inflammations, attended with many small white tubercles,
which are so frequently found upon these membranes.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
This difference arises from the circumstance, that in the
dead body these surfaces are not penetrated with blood at
the time they become putrid; whereas they contain much
during life, when putrefaction succeeds inflammation which
has filled the exhalants with it. Many other facts prove,
that the greater the quantity of blood there is in a part
when it putrefies, the more livid and black it becomes.
In the many dead bodies that I have opened, I have never
yet observed gangrene except in the peritoneum. I have
never seen it in the pleura, the arachnoides, the pericardium,
the tunica vaginalis; it no doubt takes place in
them; but I think I have opened dead bodies enough
to allow my observation to establish as a general principle;
that the peritoneum is more subject to it than all the
other analogous organs.</p>

<p>Though the different considerations offered above establish
much analogy between the cellular and the serous
systems, they exhibit however real differences. First
their external appearance is not the same. Then there is
something in their intimate nature that we are unacquainted
with, and which differs also; for whenever two organs
are identical in their nature, they are subject to the same
affections; now there is a disease of the serous surfaces
that is not seen in the cellular system; it is those slow
inflammations of which I spoke just now, a disease which
should not be ranked in the class of the phlegmasiÃ¦, and
which the production of the small tubercles that attend
it, especially characterizes. Authors who have not sufficiently
attended to it, have denominated it chronic
enteritis in the peritoneum, latent inflammation in the
pleura, &amp;c. though however foreign to every subjacent
organ, except in the latter periods when it is propagated
by the cellular texture, it has its seat exclusively in the
serous membranes, and is an affection peculiar to these
membranes, as miliary eruptions are to the cutaneous
surfaces, as aphthÃ¦ to the mucous surfaces, &amp;c. Add<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
to this difference that of the pus which the cellular texture
and the serous surfaces secrete; this fluid is not the
same in the two systems. The difference of its nature is
not known; but its external appearance is by no means
the same.</p>


<h4>II. <i>Parts common to the Organization of the Serous
System. Exhalants.</i></h4>

<p>A very evident exhalation is constantly going on upon
the serous surfaces. A particular order of vessels is the
agent of this exhalation, the matter of which is the fluid
mentioned above. These vessels are very distinctly demonstrated
in this system; it is the only one in which
the eye of the anatomist can accurately trace them. The
following are the means of seeing them; 1st, in a living
animal, draw out an intestine from the abdomen; it will
have a reddish tinge owing to the vessels under the serous
coat, and hardly at all to the vessels in this coat itself.
Irritate it, and reduce the intestine after attaching a
string to it, as in the operation of hernia where there is
gangrene, draw it out again at the end of six and thirty
or eight and forty hours; it will exhibit many reddish
lines, running over this serous surface, and showing in it
plainly the exhalants which were insensible in the natural
state, on account of the transparency of their fluids. 2d.
Very fine injections cover in an instant all the serous surfaces
with an infinite number of lines of the colour of the
injected fluid, lines which are evidently exhalants full of
this fluid. 3d. In these injections an extremely fine dew is
made to ooze out upon the smooth surface of the serous
membranes, a dew which takes place without rupture or
transudation, and of which the exhalants are the sources.
4th. If a serous surface is laid bare in a living animal,
and wiped dry, it is soon after covered with new serum,
which the exhalants furnish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span></p>


<h5><i>Absorbents.</i></h5>

<p>From the texture of the serous membranes, it is evident
that the lymphatic system enters essentially into their
formation, and that they are probably only a net-work of
exhalants and absorbents; for we have seen that the cellular
organ is an assemblage of them. But this assertion
which analogy dictates is also supported by direct proofs.
1st. The fluid of the dropsies of the different cavities
varies in density and colour; now Mascagni has always
observed that the lymphatics in their neighbourhood contained
a fluid exactly analogous. 2d. The same author
has found in two dead bodies, with a sanguineous effusion
in the thorax, the absorbents of the lungs loaded with
blood. 3d. In a man who had become emphysematous
after having been poisoned, these vessels were distended
with air. 4th. Coloured fluids injected into the abdomen
or thorax are soon after found, it is said, in the neighbouring
lymphatics, with the same colour. I have often
repeated this experiment; the injected fluid has been
soon absorbed, but not the matter which coloured it; so
that this matter, more condensed after absorption, tinged
the serous surface, the lymphatics being as transparent as
usual. It is necessary in general to choose the abdomen
for these experiments, because the absorbents being much
exposed on the liver, can be more easily examined there.
This absorbent faculty is preserved some time after death;
but care should be taken, in order to obtain then the
effect more certainly, to keep the animal, if a warm blooded
one, in a bath of nearly its own temperature; I have
had frequent opportunities of being convinced of this
truth, and of observing with Cruickshank, that what Mascagni
has said upon the absorption of dead human bodies,
fifteen, thirty, forty-eight hours even after death, is at
least very much exaggerated. 5th. The following experiment
I make every year to demonstrate the absorbents;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
I macerate for five or six hours the heart of an ox in
water; at the end of this time, the serous membrane of
this organ, which hardly allowed these vessels to be perceived,
appears to be covered with them. 6th. When
the serous membranes are inflamed, the subjacent lymphatics
are distended, like them, by the red globules of
blood, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>It appears then to be demonstrated, 1st, that the absorbents
open by an infinite number of orifices upon the
serous membranes; 2d, that their origins a thousand times
intermixed with each other, and with the orifices of the
exhalants, contribute especially to form their texture;
3d, that the difficulty of distinguishing the absorbent
and exhalant pores is no reason for denying their existence,
this difficulty arising from their extreme delicacy
and from the oblique direction in which they open between
the layers of these membranes; thus the obliquity
of the insertion of the duct of Warton, and of the ductus
choledochus even would render the inspection of them
very difficult, though these ducts were infinitely larger;
4th, that from this structure, the serous membranes, always
arranged as we have seen in the form of sacs without
an opening, should be regarded as great reservoirs
between the exhalant and absorbent systems, in which the
lymph in going from one remains some time before entering
the other, in which it undoubtedly undergoes various
preparations of which we shall always be ignorant, because
it would be necessary to analyze it comparatively
in these two orders of vessels, which is almost impossible,
at least for the first, and finally in which it serves different
uses relative to the organs around which it forms
a humid atmosphere.</p>


<h5><i>Blood Vessels.</i></h5>

<p>Do blood vessels enter into the structure of the serous
membranes? These vessels are very numerous around<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
them, as is seen in the peritoneum, the pericardium, the
pleura, &amp;c.; they wind upon their external surface and
ramify there. But I have always doubted whether the
greatest number of those which are thus contiguous to
them, really make a part of their texture, and I am even
convinced of the contrary. The following considerations
support my opinion. 1st. When these vessels are injected,
they can be easily raised with a scalpel from the external
face of these membranes, without injuring their continuity,
which can never be done in the fibrous or mucous
membranes. 2d. No blood vessel is discoverable on these
membranes which are free on both faces. The arachnoides
at the base of the cranium furnishes an example of
this. 3d. The vessels frequently change relations with
these membranes. I have proved above that when the
omentum is applied to the stomach when it is full, the
vessels that are between its layers, do not mount with it
upon this viscus, on account of the great stomachic coronary
which opposes it. When dead bodies having large
hernias are injected, the vessels that wind in the ordinary
state upon the surface of the peritoneum which
corresponds to the ring, are not seen extending below
upon the hernial sac. Certainly the vessels that are
observed in the broad ligaments of the womb, do not
follow them in the great displacements they undergo in
pregnancy.</p>

<p>I think it then very probable that the serous membranes
have but very few blood vessels; what are called arteries
of the peritoneum, the pleura, &amp;c. are but trunks winding
on their external surface, capable of abandoning it
when they are displaced, being as it were foreign to them,
not entering immediately into their structure, to which
the absorbent, exhalant and cellular systems almost alone
contribute. No doubt communications exist between the
arterial system and the serous membranes, by means of
the exhalants; but nothing precise is yet known upon the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
nature, arrangement, and to a certain extent even, the
functions of these vessels.</p>


<h4>III. <i>Varieties of Organization of the Serous System.</i></h4>

<p>We have seen the mucous system exhibiting in each
part where it is found, numerous differences of structure
and varying in each region and in each organ. The serous
system varies also, though less than the preceding. 1st.
Each membrane has its peculiar structure. Compare for
example, the arachnoides and the peritoneum; the one
fine, delicate and transparent, yields to the least effort,
has no resistance, tears almost as soon as it is touched,
never remains whole at the base of the cranium, where
it is free, if the brain is raised ever so little, and has,
when pressed between the fingers, a remarkable softness.
The other, thicker and more compact, bears without
breaking all the efforts imparted to the abdominal viscera;
it can be pulled with impunity. Its texture is wholly
different. 2d. The different portions of the serous membranes
have not the same organization; the omentum is
for example evidently dependant upon the peritoneum
and yet it does not resemble it. I have observed that the
intestinal portion of this membrane is much more delicate
than its hepatic, mesenteric portions, &amp;c. That the half
of the tunica vaginalis which lines the albuginea and is
identified with it, is certainly not the same as the half
which is free on the side of the dartos muscle. I cannot
say precisely in what these differences consist; but
the external appearance is sufficient to establish them.</p>

<p>Ought we then to be surprised, if all the serous surfaces
are not equally subject to the same diseases; if
inflammation attacks them with such different degrees of
violence; if it takes place ten times upon the pleura to
once that it appears upon the arachnoides; if in the pericardium,
the tunica vaginalis and the peritoneum, it does<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
not exhibit the same symptoms; if dropsies vary also
wonderfully in each; if the slow inflammations attack
them differently, &amp;c.? The pericardium is subject to an
affection which I have seen upon no other serous surface,
and which is yet extremely frequent upon this; I refer
to the white layers, more or less broad, that are formed
on its internal surface, which would be thought at first
view to belong to its texture, which can however be
raised from it leaving it sound. I do not know whence
these layers come; do they correspond to the false membranes
of the pleura?</p>

<p>Neither should we be surprised at what has been said
of the varieties which the same membrane exhibits in its
diseases. Frequently the whole of the peritoneum is diseased,
and the omentum remains sound and vice versa.
The layers of which I have just spoken are seen upon the
cardiac portion, and not upon the free portion of the pericardium.</p>

<p>Observe however that all the diseases of this system
have a common character which is evidently derived from
the analogy of organization. This and the synovial are
the only ones in which large serous collections take place,
in which slow and tubercular inflammations are formed.
The most of their modes of adhesion belong only to the
serous system. Inflammation has a peculiar and distinctive
character in it, of which all the serous membranes
partake with some modifications. The inflammation of
the meninges had been classed among the serous phlegmasias,
from the analogy of the symptoms, before I had
demonstrated that the arachnoides, one of these meninges,
belongs essentially to the serous system. It is on account
of this membrane, and not on account of the dura-mater
which is of a fibrous nature, that phrenitis should be
referred to the diaphanous membranes.</p>

<h3>ARTICLE THIRD.<br />

<small>PROPERTIES OF THE SEROUS SYSTEM.</small></h3>


<h4>I. <i>Properties of Texture. Extensibility.</i></h4>

<p>The serous membranes are endowed with an extensibility
much more limited, than the enormous dilatations
of which they are capable in certain cases, would at
first lead us to believe. The mechanism of their dilatation
evidently proves it. This mechanism depends upon
three principal causes; 1st, upon the development of the
folds that they form, and this is the most powerful of the
three causes. Hence why the peritoneum, which of all
the membranes of this class, is the most exposed to dilatations,
as from pregnancy, ascites and visceral enlargements,
more frequent there than elsewhere; hence, I say,
why the peritoneum exhibits so great a number of these
folds, such as the mesentery, the mesocolon, the mesorectum,
the two omentums, the fatty appendices, the fold
of the cÃ¦cal appendix, the broad ligaments of the womb,
the posterior ones of the bladder, &amp;c. &amp;c. Hence why
also these folds are seen around organs subject to habitual
alternations of dilatation and contraction, as around the
stomach, the intestines, the womb and the bladder; very
evident in the second state, but slightly apparent in the
first. 2d. The enlargement of the serous cavities belongs
to the displacements of which their membranes are capable.
Thus when the liver is considerably enlarged, its
serous membrane increases its extent in part at the expense
of that of the diaphragm, which being drawn is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
detached and applied upon the enlarged viscus. I have
seen, in an aneurism of the heart, the pericardium which
had been able to yield but very little, detached in part
from the portion of the great vessels which it covered.
3d. Finally, the texture of these membranes undergoes a
real distension and elongation. But it is in general the
least sensible cause of the enlargement of their cavity;
it is only in the great enlargements that it has an evident
influence; in common cases, the two first causes are almost
always sufficient.</p>

<p>I will make an important remark upon the subject of
the displacements of which the serous membranes are the
seat in the motions of their respective organs; it is that
these displacements are very painful when these membranes
are inflamed. When the dilated intestines separate
the two diseased layers of the mesentery to lie between
them, when the stomach goes between those of the omentum,
&amp;c. when the peritoneum is inflamed, the patient
suffers much. Hence why flatulence is then so painful,
why it is then necessary to avoid taking at once a great
quantity of drink. We know the acute pain that a long
inspiration produces in pleurisy; it is because the lungs
then dilate the pleura, and tend to go between the folds
which accompany the great pulmonary vessels.</p>


<h5><i>Contractility.</i></h5>

<p>It corresponds with the extensibility; it is less consequently
than it at first appears to be. When the peritoneum
for example is contracted, its different folds are
formed; it returns to its place after having experienced
locomotions. But it cannot be denied that in great dilatations
these two properties are very sensible; for example,
in hydrocele as the water is evacuated, the tunica vaginalis
evidently contracts. The peritoneum after the paracentesis
of the abdomen exhibits the same phenomenon.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
At the time of performing the operation of empyema,
the pleura does not experience it so sensibly, not from
defect of contractility, but because on the one hand it
adheres to the ribs which do not contract, and on the
other if the effusion is of long standing, the lungs are so
flattened by the pressure, that the air can no longer dilate
them, so that there remains a space between the costal
and pulmonary portion, which is filled with air. A similar
space would also remain at the moment of the operation,
if the serum of hydrocephalus was evacuated.</p>

<p>After long distensions, the serous membranes no longer
contract; the tunica vaginalis remains flaccid after frequent
punctures, the peritoneum after frequent pregnancies,
&amp;c. &amp;c.</p>


<h4>II. <i>Vital Properties.</i></h4>

<p>The serous surfaces, being removed from the action of
external bodies, do not enjoy in the natural state the properties
which put the living organs in relation with external
bodies; they have neither animal sensibility nor contractility.
Thus they would be very improper for external
integuments, or for linings of the organs which the
mucous membranes cover; they would give in fact no
other sensation than that of an obscure and indistinct
feeling. They answer very well for envelopes, integuments
for internal organs, but not for sensible envelopes.
We have a proof of it in living animals in whom we can
irritate these membranes with impunity. I have many
times seen dogs in whom I had left the spleen drawn out
of the abdomen, in order to observe the phenomena arising
from it, tear this organ without being in a state of fury,
eat it even and be thus nourished by their own substance.
They also often tear without pain the exterior of their
intestines when in experiments these are drawn out, and
the animals are left some time to themselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span></p>

<p>When external bodies are in contact with the serous
system, they change its natural state; they inflame it, as
we see in the peritoneum, in the tunica vaginalis laid
bare, as we observe also always when a foreign body introduced
into the system acts upon them. Surgeons, as
we know, even employ this means to which they would
in vain have recourse in the mucous membranes, in order
to procure artificial adhesions between the parietes of
these membranes. The different morbid irritations inflame
much more frequently the serous surfaces which
in this state acquire a very acute sensibility, greater even
than that of the integuments; so that these inflamed
surfaces would be equally improper to serve for integuments,
because external bodies would excite them painfully.</p>

<p>The sensible organic contractility is nothing in the
serous system; but the insensible and the corresponding
sensibility are kept in permanent exercise in it, 1st, by
the continual exhalation and absorption that are going on
there; 2d, by nutrition. These two properties are then
those which predominate in this system; thus upon their
alterations all its diseases turn. Acute inflammations,
chronic inflammations with tubercles, adhesions, dropsies,
exhalations of pus, of milky serum, &amp;c. &amp;c. are all derived
from an excess, a defect or an alteration of these
two properties of the serous system. It is then also almost
exclusively that sympathies are put into action in it; so
that the serous membranes diseased either idiopathically
or sympathetically exhibit always a series of phenomena
all of which suppose an increased internal motion, or loss
of tone in the exhalant and absorbent capillaries, and in the
peculiar texture of those membranes; whilst in the animal
muscular, the organic muscular systems, &amp;c. these predominant
affections which are marked by convulsions and
paralysis in one, and by irregular motions of irritability
in the other, do not suppose this internal alteration of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
texture of the diseased organ. Hence why these two last
systems, though frequently disturbed during life, exhibit
but few changes after death, whilst the serous system is
a vast field for the morbid anatomist.</p>


<h5><i>Sympathies.</i></h5>

<p>The serous surfaces are capable of being influenced by
the affections of the other organs; this is very evident in
the organic diseases of the heart, the lungs, the liver, the
spleen, the stomach, the womb, &amp;c. organs, which without
having any known connexion of functions with the
serous surfaces, influence them however so that all their
morbid defects of organization are accompanied, in the
latter periods, by different serous collections in the great
cavities, collections evidently owing to a derangement of
the organs which constantly exhale this fluid. I shall
make upon this point two observations; the first is that
the serous surfaces nearest the diseased organ, are in
general the most susceptible of being influenced by it.
Thus in the diseases of the heart and the lungs, the serous
collections take place especially in the thorax, whilst ascites
is always the first consequence of enlargements of
the liver, the spleen, &amp;c. the pleura and the pericardium
being filled subsequently. We know that most sarcoceles
are complicated with dropsies of the tunica vaginalis;
whence results hydro-sarcocele, a disease which surgeons
consider separately, but which is the same as those of the
preceding cases, which might in this respect be called
hydro-phthisis, chronic hydro-hepatitis, hydro-carcinoma
of the womb, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The second observation that I have to make is, that
whenever the serum is thus collected in the cavities, in
consequence of an organic disease of a viscus foreign to
the membrane, this serum is limpid, transparent, and
probably of the same nature as that which circulates in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
the lymphatic vessels. The exhalants which form it not
being then in fact diseased, their action not being increased
or that of the absorbents diminished except by sympathy,
the fluid must remain the same. Thus though there
is suffering at the end of the glans from a stone in the
bladder, the glans is perfectly sound, and the mucous
fluid that escapes from it is of the same nature as in the
ordinary state. On the contrary, when dropsies depend
upon a disease of texture of the serous surfaces, as for example
upon a tubercular inflammation, or even an acute
one, which has degenerated, &amp;c. the effused serum is
almost always altered; it is milky, or there are albuminous
flakes in it, or a false membrane, &amp;c. I have made
this observation, which I think interesting, upon nearly
all the bodies I have opened.</p>

<p>In acute diseases, the serous surfaces receive also equally
the sympathetic influence of the affected organs. If we
could then see them, we should find that they were like
the skin, more or less moist, more or less dry, according
to the different periods of the disease. What proves it
is, that at the death which follows the disease, the serum
of the pleura, the pericardium, the peritoneum, &amp;c. varies
remarkably. Sometimes it is evidently increased, at
others it is almost nothing; this depends upon the time
in which the subject died. If it is whilst exhalation is
very abundant, we find much serum; it is almost nothing
if life has been sufficiently prolonged to allow absorption
to take place. If the surrounding air did not dissolve
the sweat, or if the skin was in the form of a sac, we
should find it with very variable degrees of moisture,
according as the subjects had died in sweat, or with a
suppression of the cutaneous exhalation.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>ARTICLE FOURTH.<br />

<small>DEVELOPMENT OF THE SEROUS SYSTEM.</small></h3>


<h4>I. <i>State of this System in the First Age.</i></h4>

<p>All the serous surfaces are extremely delicate in the
fÅ“tus. In opening the thorax by a longitudinal section
of the sternum and examining the pleura in the mediastinum
where it is free on both sides, it is found to have less
thickness than the transparent layers of the omentum or
the arachnoides in the adult. The peritoneum is a little
thicker in proportion, but yet its delicacy is very great.
The comparison of soap bubbles is hardly sufficient to
convey an idea of the fineness of the texture of the
omentum and the arachnoides.</p>

<p>At this period the fluid that lubricates the serous surfaces
is much more unctuous and viscid than it is afterwards;
by carrying the fingers over these surfaces at the
different ages, the difference is easily perceived. It might
almost be said that the tangible qualities of the serous
fluids then approximate those of the synovia. I know
not to what this difference belongs.</p>

<p>Besides, the quantity of these fluids does not appear to
be so great in proportion as that of the cellular fluids,
with which they have however so much analogy; which
is probably owing to this, that the internal motions being
less numerous, on account of the inaction of most of the
organic muscles, less fluid is necessary to lubricate the
surfaces.</p>

<p>The growth of the serous system is always in proportion
to that of the organs which it covers. The arach<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>noides
is larger in proportion than it will be in the adult;
it seems even, like the brain, to become then the seat of
a more active labour; thus diseases are more frequent in
it. The increase of exhalation is more common in it
than in all the other serous sacs; hence hydrocephalus.</p>

<p>At birth, when the internal motions become suddenly
very numerous, on account of respiration, digestion and
the excretions, I presume that the serous surfaces become
the seat of a more active exhalation. Besides, as very
little blood penetrates them, the sudden production of the
red blood and its entrance by the arterial system, where it
succeeds the black blood, produces less changes upon them
than upon the mucous surfaces and the muscular system.</p>

<p>The serous membranes grow like the other organs;
for a long time delicate and diaphanous, they gradually
thicken as we advance in age, and become of a dull white.
Their suppleness diminishes as their density increases;
they resist the different reagents so much the less as the
subjects are younger. In infants, maceration and ebullition
reduce them much more quickly to a homogeneous pulp.</p>

<p>I have observed that in the fÅ“tus which has become
putrid, there is often collected different gases in the serous
cavities, as may be proved by opening these cavities under
water; a phenomenon much less evident in the adult,
in whom the cellular texture is often wholly emphysematous
by the putrefactive motion, without the escape
of any thing by the canula of a trochar which is plunged
into the peritoneal cavity or into that of the pleura, as I
have many times ascertained. In general, there is disengaged
much more aeriform fluid from the organs of the
fÅ“tus, than from those of the adult, in the experiments
of maceration.</p>


<h4>II. <i>State of the Serous System in the after Ages.</i></h4>

<p>In the adult, the serous system remains a long time
without undergoing any very sensible change; its mem<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>branes
follow only the laws of the organs they surround.
Thus in the age nearest youth, the serous surfaces of the
chest are the most frequent seat of inflammations, dropsies,
&amp;c.; whilst in that bordering on old age the inferior
surfaces like the peritoneum, are the more often affected.</p>

<p>In old age, the serous system becomes dense and compact;
its adhesions to the neighbouring parts are more
evident; thus it is less capable of the different locomotions
of which we have spoken. Its forces, which are
weakened, render absorption in it less easy; it is the frequent
seat of dropsy. When it is affected with some
diseases, its want of energy imparts to them a remarkable
chronic character. There are many old people at
the HÃ´tel Dieu with tubercular inflammations of the
peritoneum, which they have had for a long time, whilst
young persons are overcome much quicker by the same
inflammations. Thus cancers in aged persons often remain
almost inert, they frequently are not even painful,
whilst their periods are usually most rapid in adults.</p>

<p>The serous effusions are more rare than the infiltrations
of the sub-cutaneous cellular texture in old people; but
they take place more commonly than those of the intermuscular
texture.</p>

<p>The serous system becomes ossified, but not like the
arterial, the cartilaginous, &amp;c. from the natural effect of
age. Its membranes are not constantly found osseous in
old age, and when this phenomenon takes place, it happens
at every age. It is a disease, a real tumour, whilst
in the arteries and the cartilages it appears to belong to
a natural series of functions. I have a preparation in
which the arachnoides is evidently osseous in many points,
and as it is upon the dura-mater that these productions
are formed, their existence serves very well to prove that
the arachnoides is distinct from it; for at the place
where they are found, they can be easily separated from
each other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span></p>


<h4>III. <i>Preternatural Development of the Serous System.</i></h4>

<p>I shall not repeat here what I have said, in speaking of
the cellular texture, upon the formation of the different
cysts. These cysts, completely analogous to the natural
serous membranes, should be really considered as a preternatural
development of these membranes in the economy;
they have the same appearance and almost the same
texture, furnish their fluid according to the same laws,
and appear to be the seat of a constant exhalation and absorption;
since they are in vain emptied by puncture,
their fluids are always reproduced, until they are removed.
For example compare the cyst which has grown
preternaturally along the spermatic cord, with the tunica
vaginalis filled with water in hydrocele. If the size of
these tumours, which are often found together, is the
same, it is impossible to discover any difference in their
form, appearance, texture, properties, functions, &amp;c.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter"></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span></p>




<h2 id="SYNOVIAL_SYSTEM">SYNOVIAL SYSTEM.</h2>


<p>I place this system at the side of the serous, because
it has the greatest analogy with it, under the relations,
1st, of its form, which is in each of these organs
that of a sac without an opening; 2d, of its texture, which
appears to be essentially cellular; 3d, of its functions,
which consist in an alternation of exhalation and absorption.</p>

<p>What establishes a real line of demarcation between
these two systems is, 1st, that the fluids which lubricate
their membranes appear to differ in their composition,
though there is much resemblance between them. 2d.
In dropsical diatheses which affect at the same time the
cellular texture and all the serous surfaces of the peritoneum,
the pleura, &amp;c. the affection does not extend to
the synovial membranes, which indicates a difference of
structure, though we do not know what this difference is.
3d. And reciprocally in dropsies of the articulations, an
affection in general very rare, and in those of the tendinous
synovial capsules, there is no concomitant affection of
the membranes of the great cavities. 4th. The fluid of
the articular dropsies does not resemble that which fills
the great cavities in the same disease. 5th. The synovial
membranes are much more rarely than the serous, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
seat of those slow and tubercular inflammations which the
serous surfaces so often exhibit. I have however seen
two examples of it in the synovial membrane of the knee.
I believe that these two systems are the only ones in
which this disease is observed; so that it is by its existence
a character of resemblance, and by its rarity or frequency,
a distinguishing attribute. 6th. The different
kinds of adhesions of which I have spoken as taking place
on the serous surface, are not met with on the synovial
surfaces, where we see only that which identifies these
two adhering surfaces, a mode which frequently takes
place in anchylosis, which is also as often occasioned by
it, as by the stiffness of the parts surrounding the articulation.
7th. The synovial surfaces are not as often as the
serous, the seat of those remarkable locomotions of which
we have spoken; which depends on this, that the articular
organs are not, like the most of those covered with
serous surfaces, subject to alternate dilatations and contractions.</p>

<p>The synovial system exhibits evidently two great divisions.
To one belongs the articular system, to the other
that of the tendinous grooves. Each shall be examined
separately.</p>


<hr class="chap" />

<h3>ARTICLE FIRST.<br />

<small>ARTICULAR SYNOVIAL SYSTEM.</small></h3>

<p>I believe that I first described this essential portion of
the synovial system. I shall relate here what I have said
of it elsewhere. I shall examine first how it is separated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
from the blood, afterwards the fluid itself, and then I shall
describe the organ which furnishes it.</p>


<h4>I. <i>How the Synovia is separated from the mass of
Blood.</i></h4>

<p>Every fluid differing from the blood, can be separated
from it to be afterwards transmitted to an organ, but in
one of the three following ways; 1st, by secretion, a function
characterized by the existence of a gland intermediate
to the blood vessels that bring the materials to it,
and the excretories which carry off the result; 2d, by
exhalation, a function distinguished from the first, by the
absence of this intermediate gland, and by the immediate
continuity of the blood vessel and the exhaling duct; 3d,
by transudation, a phenomenon purely physical, almost
always happening after death, rarely observed during life,
a simple transmission of a fluid by the pores of an organ,
towards which it is mechanically determined. Let us
examine which of these three modes is that chosen by
nature to deposit the synovia upon the articular surfaces.</p>

<h5><i>Is the synovia transmitted by secretion to the articular
surfaces?</i></h5>

<p>We are indebted to Clopton Havers for the system
which places in the glands the sources of the synovia.
Many authors had designated obscurely before him these
organs in the articulations; but he made them the particular
object of his researches, described them in the different
articulations, divided them into two classes, the
one principal, the other accessory, and assigned them
characters so evident, that according to him, they could
not be forgotten. Reddish bunches, spongy, formed by
membranes folded upon themselves, situated sometimes
without, and sometimes within the articulations, always
arranged so as to be protected from too strong a compression,
and pouring out through ducts in the form of fringe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
the fluid they secrete; such are the characters drawn by
Havers, which all anatomists since him admire, and the
correctness of which the most modern and distinguished
authors have acknowledged in their works.</p>

<p>Some anatomists of this age have however thrown
doubts upon these glandular bodies. Lieutaud confounds
them with the fatty cellular texture. Desault did not
distinguish them from it. Every thing confirms me in
the same opinion, which many considerations appear to
establish in an undoubted manner. The following are
these considerations; 1st, these reddish bunches are met
with only in certain articulations. There are many of
them in which their existence cannot be established but
by supposition. 2d. The greatest number of the synovial
membranes of the tendons certainly do not exhibit any
of them, though Havers, Albinus, Juncke and Fourcroy
admit them in all, founded no doubt upon analogy and
not upon inspection. Yet the synovia is separated equally
in both cases, and lubricates the surfaces of the articulations
and of the tendinous sheaths; this separation is then
independent of glandular action. 3d. If the best marked
synovial glands are examined, such as that of the cotyloid
cavity, no trace can be discovered there of this parenchyma
of an unknown nature, but remarkable for its
structure, which composes in general the glands, and
which distinguishes them from every other part and forms
their true organic character. 4th. No excretory duct can
be demonstrated in these organs. Those in the form of
fringes, admitted by Havers, are imaginary. Bertin himself
has acknowledged this truth, though he attributed to
these bodies a glandular structure. The transudation of
the fluids injected by the arteries in the neighbourhood
of the articulation, proves the existence of these ducts no
better than it establishes them in the cavities of the
serous membranes in which it also takes place, and yet
in which it is well proved that no gland pours out the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
albuminous fluid that constantly lubricates these cavities.
5th. Inflation resolves completely these fatty bunches into
cellular texture. Maceration produces the same effect.
When gradual and long continued ebullition has removed
all the fat from them, there remains only a mass of cells
pressed together, and similar to those of the common
cellular texture. 6th. The glandular character is manifested
in certain morbid cases, by a peculiar swelling and
hardening, of which the other organs except the glands,
such as the muscles, the tendons, &amp;c. never offer an example.
The liver, the kidneys, the salivary organs, all the
considerable glands are remarkable for this. So true is this
character, that it serves to indicate glands, the delicacy
of which conceals them in the natural state. For example,
the existence of the cryptÃ¦ of the stomach, the
urethra, and several other mucous membranes, is founded
first upon the analogy of the other membranes of this
class, but principally upon the preternatural development
which these cryptÃ¦ acquire in certain diseases. Never,
on the contrary, do the pretended synovial glands present
to the observer a similar development. Always in
the diseases of the articulations, a common swelling seems
to identify them with the neighbouring cellular texture.
They have not like the other glands, affections distinct
from those of this texture, no doubt because they have
not a peculiar vitality, because being mere elongations of
the neighbouring cellular texture, they partake of its
nature and properties, and ought consequently to partake
of all its conditions, as it in its turn ought immediately to
receive the influence of their affections.</p>

<p>The considerations which I have just offered successively
form, I think, sufficient data to resolve the problem
proposed above, by establishing as an incontestable proposition,
that the synovia is not transmitted by secretion to
the articular surfaces.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span></p>

<p>Let us examine the second mode of transmission stated
by authors.</p>

<h5><i>Is the synovia transmitted by transudation to the
articular surfaces?</i></h5>

<p>It was an opinion anciently received, that the marrow
of the long bones oozes through the pores of their extremities
and through those of the cartilages which terminate
them, to lubricate the articular surfaces. Havers
renewed this idea forgotten at the time he wrote, united
this source of the synovia to that which had placed it in
the glands, and thus formed of this fluid a mixture composed
of two fluids differently transmitted to the articulation.
The most of those who succeeded him partook of
his opinion upon this point. Those even, such as Desault,
who rejected the existence of the articular glands
and the secretion of synovia, admitted the transudation
of it founded upon the following observations. 1st. A
long bone, stripped of its soft parts and exposed to the
air, allows a fatty oozing to pass through the pores of its
cartilages which does not cease till the medullary juice is
completely exhausted. 2d. The mechanical compression
of the cartilaginous extremity of a long bone produces
for a moment the same effect. Are these facts, which
are evident in the dead bone, also real in the living one?
Different considerations, which I will now state, induce
one to believe the contrary.</p>

<p>1st. The vital forces, the effect of which is to impart
to all the organs which they animate a degree of tone
sufficient to resist the entrance of the fluids, leave, when
they are extinct, the fibres of these same organs in a state
of laxity that renders them everywhere permeable. Thus
transudation is now considered as hardly any thing else
than a phenomenon that takes place only after death,
which, if transformed into a vital one, would offer an evident
exception to the laws of nature that are especially
characterized by simplicity and uniformity. 2d. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
fatty oozing takes place in the experiment noticed above,
not only through the pores of the cartilages, but also
through those of the whole surface of the bone; so that
by reasoning from what has been here observed upon the
dead body, it is evident that during life the whole bone
would be, if you may so say, immersed in an atmosphere
of synovia, a consequence, which being proved false
by the most simple inspection, demonstrates the falsity
of the principle deduced from it. 3d. The articulations
of the cartilages of the larynx are lubricated like those of
the bones, by the synovial fluid; and yet here all transudation
of marrow is impossible, as it does not exist in the
substances of the cartilages. 4th. The marrow is almost
always sound in diseases which, affecting the articulations
alter the fluid that lubricates them. And reciprocally the
synovia does not take a different character in the affections
of the interior of the bones, which have an influence
especially upon the medullary organ. 5th. Finally, the
experiment that I have made, and which has been stated
in the article upon the marrow, evidently proves the
non-transudation of this fluid.</p>

<p>Desault, in order to explain the manner in which the
synovia is separated from the blood, added to this pretended
transudation of the marrow, an oozing furnished
by all the parts contained in the articulation, such as the
capsular and inter-articular ligaments, the internal fat, the
cartilages, &amp;c. A comparison will suffice to show the
value of this hypothesis. What should we say of a system
in which to explain the production of the serous fluid
of the abdomen, the source of it should be placed in the
liver, the spleen, the intestines, and in general in all the
organs of this cavity? No doubt we should answer,
that a fluid of the same nature, could not be furnished by
parts of such different structure, that it is much more
simple to search for a single source in the single membrane
that covers all the gastric viscera. The application<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
is exact and the analogy perfect between it and the articular
cavity.</p>

<p>We can, I believe, without fear of error, conclude from
all that has been said above, that the synovia is not transmitted
by transudation to the articular surfaces.</p>

<p>I will now examine the last mode pointed out for the
separation of the synovia.</p>

<h5><i>Is the synovia transmitted by exhalation to the articular
surfaces?</i></h5>

<p>The solution of the two preceding problems seem naturally
to lead to that of the question which we here propose.
The certainty of the two following data may, I
think, be relied on; 1st. Secretion, exhalation and transudation
are the only means by which a fluid different from
the blood can be transmitted to an organ. 2d. Secretion
and transudation are foreign to the transmission of the
synovia. Now from these two certain data, can we not
draw this conclusion as certain, that exhalation is the
mode by which the synovia is carried to the articulations?
But let us add to these negative proofs some considerations
which establish this proposition positively.</p>

<p>The most striking relations are observed between the
synovia and the fluid that lubricates the parietes of the
serous membranes. 1st. The relation of composition.
These two fluids are essentially albuminous. Albumen predominates
in both, though a little different in each, as Marguerron
has demonstrated. Havers had previously pointed
out this analogy; he knew that these two fluids are coagulable
by alkohol, the acids, and caloric, without knowing
the principle to which this property is owing. 2d.
The relation of functions. Both are destined to lubricate
surfaces on which much motion takes place, to diminish
the friction which is the inevitable consequence of it and to
prevent fatal adhesions. Both are in the same state on
their respective surfaces; it is merely a dew spread upon
these surfaces, and soon taken up from them. 3d. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
relation of affections. Inflammation dries up the source of
both, and produces adhesions, more common in the serous
membranes and more rare in the articulations in which
they produce anchylosis. Both are subject to preternatural
enlargement, which is designated by a common
word, viz. dropsy. 4th. The relation of absorption. The
lymphatic system is for both the way by which they re-enter
the circulation, after having remained sufficiently
long upon their respective surfaces.</p>

<p>Do not these various resemblances, which with some
slight differences of composition only, so evidently connect
the synovia with the fluid of the serous membranes,
lead us to this very simple consequence, viz. that these
two fluids being analogous in all other respects must be
so also as to the manner in which they are separated from
the mass of blood? Now it is a point in physiology at
the present day generally acknowledged, that the fluid of
the serous membranes is brought to them by exhalation;
then we are evidently lead by induction to this which
answers the question proposed above; The synovia is
transmitted by exhalation to the articular surfaces.</p>

<p>This rigorous and accurate conclusion drawn from obvious
and uniform facts will become, I think, a demonstrated
truth, when to the analogies already established
we shall add that of the membranous organ, the essential
seat of the exhalation of the synovia.</p>


<h4>II. <i>Remarks upon the Synovia.</i></h4>

<p>Thus separated from the mass of blood, the synovia has
the appearance of a white, viscid and transparent fluid.
It ropes, like some syrups, when it flows from the articulations.
This unctuous property renders it peculiarly fit
to lubricate the articular surfaces which rub together, and
to protect them from violent shocks.</p>

<p>Its quantity varies; there are articulations which contain
much of it; that of the ankle has always appeared to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
me to have the most of it. Then come the ilio-femoral,
the scapulo-humeral, the humero-cubital, &amp;c. There are
others in which there is scarcely any; such are the sterno-clavicular,
the sterno-costals, the costo-vertebrals, &amp;c. It
is not the smallness of the synovial surfaces that occasions
in these articulations the constant dryness that is observed
in them; for the synovial sacs of the larynx, which are
much smaller, are much more moist.</p>

<p>Besides, the synovia does not vary in quantity in each
articulation, like the serum in the serous membranes.
Those who have opened peritoneums, pleuras, pericardiums,
&amp;c. must have seen that hardly two are similar;
sometimes there is only a mere dew, at others there is a
real collection of fluid. Here on the contrary there is
always nearly the same quantity; which is owing to this,
that the synovial surface does not feel as easily as the
serous surfaces, the sympathetic influences of the other
organs when diseased.</p>

<p>The synovia is not subject to the different alterations
which the serous fluids exhibit. I have never seen upon
the articular surfaces what are called false membranes
from inflammation. The preternatural collections of synovia
never contain those white flakes, so common in the
serous collections. I do not know of an example of
milky serum effused in an articulation. One of the most
frequent alterations of the synovia is that, I think, in
which it takes the consistence of a jelly and is of a reddish
colour, analogous, if I may be allowed the comparison, to
currant jelly. Now this alteration is wholly foreign to
the serous fluids.</p>

<p>These essential differences which the synovia and the
serum exhibit in their alterations, evidently suppose a
diversity of nature in the principles which compose them
in the natural state. The viscidity of one and the greater
fluidity of the other, also declare it, as Fourcroy has observed.
This diversity of nature appears to depend espe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>cially
upon a peculiar substance which enters into the
composition of the synovia, which few animal fluids
possess, which Marguerron who has observed it designates
by the name of albumen of a peculiar nature, and
which should be the object of new researches.</p>

<p>I shall not give here the details of the analysis of the
synovia; they belong to animal chemistry.</p>


<h4>III. <i>Of the Synovial Membranes.</i></h4>

<p>We have seen all the great cavities lined by the serous
membranes, which form by their folds species of sacs
without an opening, and which embrace both the organs
and the parietes of these cavities. There exists in all the
moveable articulations membranes precisely analogous, the
uses of which are the same, the nature of which is not
different and which I call synovial, because their parietes
constantly exhale and absorb synovia.</p>


<h5><i>Forms.</i></h5>

<p>Every synovial membrane then, should be considered
as a sac without an opening, spread upon the organs of
articulation, upon the diarthrodial cartilages, upon the
internal face of the lateral and capsular ligaments, upon
the whole of the inter-articular ligaments when they exist,
upon the prominent fatty bunches in some articular cavities,
&amp;c. It is from it that these different organs borrow
the smooth, polished and shining appearance which characterizes
them in these cavities, and which they have
not elsewhere. Just as by dissecting carefully the gastric
organs, the peritoneum can be removed, its sac remaining
whole, so we can conceive of the possibility of separating
this membrane, notwithstanding the intimate adhesions
it forms in some places. All the parts that it embraces
are out of the articular cavity, though projecting
into this cavity, as the lungs are found on the exterior of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
the sac formed by the pleura, the liver on the exterior of
the peritoneal sac, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>The synovial membrane is found in all the moveable
articulations, the greatest number of which has only it
and the lateral ligaments. What is commonly called the
fibrous capsule is only met with around some of the articular
surfaces. The connexions of the humerus, the
femur, and one or two other bones, the extremities of
which are joined by enarthrosis, present the only examples
of it. There are seen in these articulations two very
distinct coverings. One which is fibrous is external, and
is found arranged in the form of a sac open above and
below, embracing by its two great openings the surfaces
of the two bones, and being intermixed around them
with the periosteum, the fibres of both interlace with each
other. The other cellular, which is the synovial membrane,
lines the first on the interior, separates afterwards
from it when it arrives towards the two diarthrodial
cartilages, and is reflected upon them, instead of being
united to the periosteum. Boyer has pointed out this
arrangement in regard to the femur.</p>

<p>In all the ginglymoid articulations, as in those of the
elbow, the knee, the phalanges, the hand, the foot, &amp;c.
&amp;c. the fibrous capsule is wholly wanting. The fibres,
instead of extending and interlacing in the form of a membrane,
are collected into fasciculi more or less thick, which
form the lateral ligaments. There is only found in them
the internal layer of the enarthrodial articulations, that is to
say the synovial membrane, which does not contract here
any adhesion with the periosteum, but is reflected upon
the cartilages. By taking it at the place of this reflection,
it can be detached far enough to prove that it has an
external organization wholly different from that which
the idea of a capsular ligament at first presents to the
mind. This arrangement is very easily perceived by
the least dissection, at the knee behind the tendon of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
crurÃ¦us and the inferior ligament of the patella, at the
elbow under the tendon of the triceps, at the phalanges
under that of the extensor, &amp;c. All the arthrodial articulations
have also an analogous organization, as will be seen in
the Descriptive Anatomy; so that it is ascertained that
the fibrous capsules exist but in a very small number of
articulations, that almost all have only synovial sacs
which are spread out and reflected upon the osseous surfaces,
without being attached around them, as all authors
have said.</p>

<p>I have proved this remarkable difference of the articulations
by many dissections. Some anatomists were in the
way to discover it, when they observed that the different
capsules appeared to be wholly formed of cellular texture.
It is in fact the texture of the synovial membrane,
which differs essentially in this from the fibrous capsules.
The mode of capsule for all articulations may be preserved,
if it is wished, but different ideas must then necessarily
be attributed to it. Compare, for example, the
fibrous capsule of the femur with the synovial capsule of
the knee; you will find on the one hand, 1st, a cylindrical
sac with two great openings for the osseous extremities,
and with many small ones for the vessels; 2d, a
fibrous interlacing, similar to that of the tendons, the
aponeuroses, &amp;c.; 3d, a mode of sensibility analogous to
that of these organs; 4th, the use of retaining strongly
in place the articulated bones, which have only this bond
to strengthen their union. On the other hand you will
observe, 1st, a sac without an opening; 2d, a cellular
structure, the same as that of the serous membranes; 3d,
a sensibility of the same nature as theirs; 4th, the simple
function of containing the synovia and separating it, the
bones being tied by strong ligaments. Besides, the different
reagents have upon the fibrous capsules an influence
wholly different from that which they exert upon the
synovial. Ebullition yellows them, renders them semi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>-transparent,
softens them like tendons and gradually melts
them like gelatine. The synovial ones boiled remain
whitish, and furnish but little of this substance. I would
observe that the yellowish tinge and semi-transparency
of the boiled fibrous capsules are a certain means of distinguishing
the articulations in which they exist and those
which are destitute of them.</p>

<p>The existence of the synovial capsule in the greatest
number of articulations in which it is found alone, is
placed beyond a doubt by the slightest inspection. In
those in which it is united to a fibrous capsule, it is very
clearly distinguished in several places. Thus in the thigh,
it is found upon the interarticular ligament, upon the
fatty bunch in the cotyloid cavity, and upon the neck of
the bone at the places where it leaves the fibrous capsule,
to be reflected upon the cartilages, &amp;c.; but its adhesion
to these cartilages and to the internal face of the capsule,
may excite some doubts as to its arrangement in the form
of a sac everywhere closed, which we have attributed to
it; it is then essential to offer some considerations that
may dissipate these doubts.</p>

<p>1st. However strong the adhesions of the synovial membrane
may be, they can be destroyed without a solution of
continuity, by a slow, careful dissection begun at the place
where the membrane is reflected from the cartilage upon
the capsule. It can be taken away in parts after long continued
maceration. 2d. In consequence of certain inflammations,
this membrane acquires a thickness and opacity
which enable us to distinguish it from all the neighbouring
organs, from those even to which it adheres the most.
3d. The synovial bags are all as adherent as the articular
synovial one, to the cartilages of their sheath and to this
sheath itself; yet every one acknowledges their distinct
existence. 4th. There are articulations with a fibrous
capsule, in which the fibres are separated so as to leave a
space between them through which the synovia would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
escape, if the synovial membrane did not line them.
When air is forced into the articulation, this membrane
rises up in these spaces and exhibits a texture wholly
different from that of the capsule. Bertin observed this,
but thought that these pellicles were insulated, and did
not see that they depended upon the continuity of the
membrane which is extended over the whole articulation.
5th. We have observed in the article upon the serous
system, that the smooth and polished appearance which
the surface of the organs and the cavities exhibit, is
always given to them by these membranes, and that
they never derive it from their peculiar structure; now
we shall see that the synovial membrane has almost the
same texture as the serous; then it appears that in the
places in which the articular organs exhibit this character,
it is from it that they receive it, though it cannot be
distinguished as well upon these organs, as where it is
free. Besides, the articulations that are evidently destitute
of this membrane, have not this smooth and polished
appearance. Such are the surfaces of the symphysis pubis,
and of the sacro-iliac symphysis which are found, though
contiguous, unequal, rough, &amp;c. We have also proved
that this organic form is never owing to compression.</p>

<p>From these different considerations we may be easily
convinced, I think, that notwithstanding the adhesion
of the synovial membrane at different points, it should
be considered in a manner precisely analogous to that of
the serous membranes, that is to say as a real sac without
an opening, everywhere contiguous and spread upon all
the organs of the articulation. Besides, do not the fibroserous
membranes exhibit similar adhesions, though the
separate existence of the two layers which compose them
is generally admitted?</p>

<p>From the idea we have formed of the synovial membrane,
it is easy to conceive how certain organs pass
through the articulation, without the escape of the syno<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>via
by the opening which receives or by that which transmits
them. The synovial membrane then reflected around
these organs, forms for them a sheath which separates
them from the fluid and keeps them distinct from the
articulation. Thus the tendon of the biceps is no more
contained in the articulation of the arm with the scapula,
than the umbilical vein, the urachus, &amp;c. are in the peritoneal
cavity. With the least care it may be separated from
the portion of membrane which forms its sheath.</p>

<p>The preceding considerations lead us also to find a perfect
identity in the synovial capsules of the tendons and
the articular synovial ones. In the preceding example,
these two kinds of membranes are evidently continuous;
for the capsule of the groove of the biceps is of the same
nature as that of the tendons which have a separate one
from it, as the flexors, for example.</p>


<h5><i>Organization.</i></h5>

<p>We have just seen, that the synovial membrane resembles
very much in its external conformation the class of
serous membranes, it does not less so in its internal organization.
This organization is cellular, as is proved by
dissection, inflation and especially maceration. The sac
which the ganglions form is evidently only a production
of the cellular organ; now it is known that this sac exhales
and contains a fluid similar to the synovia. Wherever
the synovial membrane is free, it is attached externally to
this organ and is confounded with it in so direct a manner,
that by raising successively its different layers they
are seen to be gradually condensed and finally united
together to form it. So that in the serous membranes no
fibre is visible. It becomes transparent when it is separated
accurately on both sides, which is easily done at
the knee to a great extent.</p>

<p>I shall not go back to the various proofs which establish
the cellular structure of the serous system; almost all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
these proofs are applicable to the synovial system, which
appears to be but a net-work of absorbents and exhalants.
Hence it is easy to understand what the red and fatty
bunches are that are found around the articulations.
They perform in regard to this membrane the functions
of the abundant cellular texture which envelops the peritoneum,
the pleura, &amp;c. &amp;c. It is there that the blood
vessels divide ad infinitum before arriving at the membrane
where their ramifications, successively decreasing,
finally terminate in the exhalants.</p>

<p>If a remarkable redness sometimes distinguishes these
bunches from the cellular texture, it is because the vessels
are more concentrated and nearer together in them. For
example, in the articulation of the hip, the synovial
membrane of which, almost everywhere adherent, only
corresponds in the fissure of the cotyloid cavity with the
cellular texture, nature has placed there almost all the
arterial ramifications that furnish the synovia; hence the
reddish tinge of the cellular bunch that is found there.
On the contrary, at the knee where much cellular texture
surrounds the whole external face of the synovial sac, the
vessels more scattered leave to this texture the same
colour as that of the external face of the serous membranes,
&amp;c. This redness of some pretended synovial
glands, the only character that distinguishes them, is then
as it were merely accidental; it no more indicates their
glandular nature, than it proves it in the pia-mater, in
which it is owing to the same cause.</p>

<p>Though the synovial membrane is very analogous to
the serous surfaces, it must however exhibit differences
of texture, since the fluid it exhales is a little different.
In fact, by examining it at the femoro-tibial articulation,
where it can be found in considerable pieces, it is seen to
be more dense and compact than the serous membranes.
Its texture has not the suppleness of theirs; when dried,
it is much more brittle; it remains stiff, whilst the serous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
texture is moved in all directions without the least effort.
It resists maceration longer.</p>


<h5><i>Properties.</i></h5>

<p>The properties of texture become evident in articular
dropsies, in which the synovial membranes are at first
much distended, and in which they contract after the
puncture, an operation however that is very rare. Yet
it appears that these membranes are only susceptible of a
slow and gradual extension. We know that suddenly
separated in luxations, their parietes tear instead of stretching;
they unite again after the reduction.</p>

<p>Among the vital properties, the organic sensibility is the
only one of this system in the ordinary state, as I have
proved by many experiments on living animals in which
these surfaces have been laid bare and irritated by various
agents. But the increase of life which inflammation produces
by raising this sensibility, transforms it into animal
sensibility; this is what is observed, 1st, in the wounds in
which these membranes are exposed to the contact of the
air; 2d, in the long continued irritation they experience
from foreign bodies preternaturally developed in the articulation;
3d, in the various affections of the articular
surfaces, &amp;c.</p>

<p>This kind of sensibility of the synovial membranes
serves to confirm what I have already established above,
viz. that most of the articulations, the ginglymoid especially,
are destitute of fibrous capsules. In fact, I have
observed that these capsules, as well as the lateral ligaments,
have a kind of animal sensibility, which is developed
by pulling them; so that if all the neighbouring
organs of an articulation, except the synovial membrane
and the lateral ligaments, are removed and this articulation
afterwards twisted, the animal gives signs of the
most acute pain. But afterwards cut the ligaments, and
leave only the synovial membrane, the twisting no longer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
gives pain; then there is no fibrous capsule united to the
synovial. This experiment, which is easily repeated
upon the fore or hind legs, enables us to recognise everywhere
the articulations in which the synovial membrane
exists alone, and those in which it is found united to a
fibrous capsule. This being of the same texture as the
lateral ligaments, produces the same pains when it is
pulled, as is proved elsewhere by experiments made upon
the articulations clothed with these capsules.</p>

<p>The alternate exhalation and absorption which takes
place upon the serous surfaces, prove the insensible contractility
in them.</p>

<p>I have already observed that the synovial surfaces perform
but a small part in the sympathies, that they feel
but very slightly the affections of the other organs. Whilst
in the acute affections of the important viscera, the skin,
the mucous surfaces, the cellular texture, the nerves, &amp;c.
&amp;c. have a greater or less sympathetic derangement, all
the synovial membranes remain unaffected; they do not
become the seat of irregular pains, nor of a more active
or slower exhalation. They resemble in this respect the
osseous, cartilaginous, and even fibrous systems. Thus
it is not necessary that the physician should seek in the
synovial system a frequent seat of the accessory symptoms
in diseases, of that class of symptoms which does
not belong to the injury of the diseased organ itself, but
to its relations with other parts.</p>

<p>In the pains of the articulations, there are certainly cases
in which the synovial membrane is diseased, and others
in which the fibrous organs alone are affected. The distinction
of these cases should be sought.</p>


<h5><i>Functions.</i></h5>

<p>The synovial membrane adds nothing to the solidity
of the articulation. The fibrous capsules and the lateral
ligaments alone serve this purpose. The smooth surface<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
which the articular extremities derive from this membrane,
favours their motions; it can even in this way
assist the muscular action; thus the portions of synovial
membrane which are found at the knee behind the crurÃ¦us,
at the elbow under the triceps, at the phalanges
under the flexors, &amp;c. perform in respect to these muscles,
the same functions as the tendinous synovial bags. They
are to their tendons, what the cellular sac which separates
the tendons of the psoas and the iliacus from the crural
arch, is to them.</p>

<p>The principal use of the membrane of which we are
treating is in relation to the synovia. It exhales by
numerous orifices this fluid which remains there for some
time, and afterwards re-enters the circulation by absorption.
Its parietes are then the seat of exhalation, as the
kidneys, for example, are that of the secretion of urine.
The reservoir of the exhaled fluid is the sac without opening
which it forms, as the bladder is that of the urine that
comes from the kidneys. The excretory vessels of this
same fluid are the absorbents which carry it into the mass
of blood, as the urethra carries the urine from the bladder.
There is under these different relations more analogy than
there at first seems to be, between secretion and exhalation.</p>

<p>The phenomena of the continuance of the synovia in
this membranous reservoir, have relation to the synovia
itself or to the articular surfaces. The first consist in a
peculiar but unknown alteration which it undergoes between
the exhalant and absorbent systems. The second
contribute to facilitate the articular motions. The unctuous
and slippery coat which the serous surfaces receive
from the synovia, is remarkably adapted to this use, as I
have observed.</p>


<h5><i>Natural Development.</i></h5>

<p>In the fÅ“tus and in infancy most of the synovial membranes
are much larger in proportion than in the after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
ages, because the articular surfaces have a greater extent
in the cartilaginous than in the osseous state; but they
are then extremely delicate. The synovia is not, as the
serous fluids are at this age, more unctuous and of greater
consistence; it appears even to be less so. Before
birth it is in small quantity, no doubt because the motions
are trifling.</p>

<p>In old age I have observed that the synovial membrane
becomes more dense and compact. It loses in part its
white colour and becomes grey; less synovia is exhaled
from it. It is not like the serous surfaces, exposed to
dropsies. The rigidity it acquires makes motion painful.
It never ossifies except preternaturally. The phosphate
of lime which gradually invades cartilage, does not take
hold of it. I do not know an instance of an old person
in whom bone has been found naked in an articulation.</p>


<h5><i>Preternatural Development.</i></h5>

<p>I have already observed in the article on the fibrous
capsules, that when the head of a bone remains displaced
in a luxation, it is not a membrane analogous to these
capsules that is developed around it; it is a real cyst,
smooth on its internal surface, moistened with serum,
formed at the expense of the cellular texture, and presenting,
with a little more thickness, the true appearance of
the synovial membranes; it is a preternatural synovial
membrane. The motions imparted to the displaced limb
appear to increase the serous exhalation in this new membrane;
hence no doubt the great advantage of these motions,
in order to re-establish in part the mobility of the
bones which remain out of their sockets. I have seen a
dancer, the head of whose humerus was lodged in the
hollow of the axilla, after a luxation that was not reduced,
perform very varied motions with it.</p>

<h3>ARTICLE SECOND.<br />

<small>SYNOVIAL SYSTEM OF THE TENDONS.</small></h3>

<p>This system noticed by many authors and described
by Fourcroy, Soemmering, &amp;c. is precisely of the same
nature as the preceding, from which it differs only by its
situation; it is often even confounded with it. Thus the
synovial membrane of the tendon of the biceps is continuous
with that of the scapulo-humeral articulation;
thus those of the gemelli are so with the synovial membrane
of the femoro-tibial articulation; it is the same
membrane which belongs at the same time to the tendon
and to the articulation. A remarkable example of it is
seen in the extensors of the leg and the ham, to the tendons
of which the same articular synovial membrane of
the knee serves for a capsule.</p>

<p>But very few tendinous synovial membranes are found
in the trunk; almost all are on the extremities where they
serve to assist the slipping of the tendons. They are
met with, 1st, where a tendon is reflected at an angle
upon a bone, as around those of the great lateral peroneus,
the peroneus medius, the obturator internus, the great
oblique of the eye, &amp;c.; 2d, where a tendon slips upon
an osseous surface without being reflected, as at the extremity
of the tendo Achillis, as under that of the great
glutÃ¦us, and those of the psoas and iliacus united; 3d,
where a tendon slips in a fibrous capsule, as in those of
all the flexors, &amp;c. Their extent is uniformly in proportion
to that of the tendons upon which they are spread.</p>


<h5><i>Forms; Relations; Synovial Fluid.</i></h5>

<p>The tendinous synovial membranes, are, like the articular
ones, sacs without an opening, spread on the one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
hand on the tendon and on the other upon the neighbouring
organs. These sacs are differently shaped according
to the arrangement of the tendon, but their general conformation
is uniform. We see from this that every tendinous
synovial membrane has two faces, one which
forms the interior of the sac, which is everywhere free
and contiguous to itself, the other which lines the adjacent
organs.</p>

<p>The free surface is constantly moistened by a fluid precisely
similar to that of the articulations, furnished like
it by exhalation, and not as authors have said by red
bodies situated in the neighbourhood, bodies of which
oftentimes there is no trace visible, and which, when
they exist, have nothing glandular in them. This fluid
is in general much less abundant than in the articulations,
at least in the dead body. But there are varieties in the
different synovial bags; those of the tendo Achillis, of
the tendons of the psoas and iliacus united, of that of the
obturator internus, &amp;c. are always more moist than those
of the flexor tendons, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Is it to the absence of synovia that must be attributed
the species of crepitation which the tendons sometimes
make in their motions? I know not. I would only
observe that this crepitation has some analogy with the
crackling noise of the joints of the fingers when they are
bent quickly, a noise, which does not depend, as might
be supposed, on the friction of the osseous surfaces; in
fact, when it has been once produced, it cannot be again,
though there may be friction again. Besides it is known
that this crackling noise arises from the forced elongation
of the phalanges, and consequently from the separation
of their articular surfaces, as well as from the flexion.</p>

<p>The increase of the fluid of the tendinous synovial
membranes forms a species of dropsy which is called
ganglion, a tumour which never exists in the synovial
membranes of the fingers, no doubt on account of the want<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
of extensibility of the fibrous capsules. It should not be
thought however that all these tumours, which are cured
by bursting them by strong pressure and thus effusing the
fluid into the cellular membrane, have for their base a
natural synovial membrane. Most frequently they are
preternatural; they are cysts which are formed in the cellular
texture. In fact these tumours are often found in
the course of the great extensor of the thumb, where there
is no synovial membrane. After rheumatic pains I have
seen a considerable collection of fluid in the small synovial
membrane of the tendo Achillis; it gradually disappeared.
I have observed another analogous one in the
bag of the psoas of a dead body. The fluid was reddish
and of the consistence of currant jelly. The action of
nitric acid immediately coagulated it into a white mass,
analogous to the white of an egg hardened.</p>

<p>The adhering surface of the tendinous synovial membranes
is spread, 1st, on the one hand upon the tendons,
with which it is more or less intimately united. It is
easily detached from those of the internal obturator, the
psoas, &amp;c. It is closely connected with those of the flexors.
2d. On the other hand, it commonly lines the periosteum,
which, in this place, is penetrated with gelatine,
and forms a fibro-cartilage. Its mode of relation is there
analogous to that of the articular synovial membrane with
the cartilage of the bone. Sometimes it is reflected upon
a fibrous capsule after having lined the tendon; such are
those which are in the neighbourhood of the scapulo-humeral
articulation. In some cases, after having lined
the tendon, they mount up to the fleshy fibres, as on the
obturator internus. 3d. By reflecting from the tendon
upon the neighbouring organs, they answer in general instead
of much cellular texture; but in the grooves of the
flexors, it is the fibrous sheaths which they clothe.</p>

<p>In all the great motions, the tendinous synovial membranes,
stretched more or less, undergo various locomo<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>tions,
always less however than those of the serous surfaces.</p>

<p>The very various forms, which the sac without opening of
the tendinous synovial membranes exhibits, can
be reduced to two general modifications. 1st. Some are
rounded sacs, species of bladders; such are those upon
the supra-spinatus, the psoas, iliacus, obturator internus,
&amp;c. All these membranes are remarkable for this, that
they never cover the tendon entirely, but only on one
side; that they never form internal folds and that they
are never surrounded by fibrous sheaths. 2d. The others,
belonging especially to the flexors, and to the different
tendons which traverse the sole of the foot, form at first
a kind of cylindrical sac which lines the canal half fibrous,
half cartilaginous in which the tendon slips; then they
are reflected around it, cover it wholly and form for it a
true sheath which prevents it from being moistened by
the synovia. This kind of tendinous synovial membrane
represents then truly two canals, at the superior and inferior
extremities of which are found two cul-de-sacs
which unite them and complete the sac without an opening.
Internal folds are here frequently found going from
one canal to the other. All the synovial membranes of
the flexors have one of them under the tendon.</p>


<h5><i>Organization; Properties; Development.</i></h5>

<p>The organization of the tendinous synovial membranes
is precisely analogous to that of the articular ones. Principally
cellular, the texture of these membranes is without
any apparent fibre; its softness is very evident; very
few blood vessels are distributed to it, though the contrary
has been said; absorbents and exhalants especially
predominate in it. These, filled with blood in inflammation,
give to the membrane, a reddish tinge, more or less
deep. In this state the synovia is not exhaled; sometimes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
even adhesions are formed, as I have observed in a subject
in whom the fibrous sheaths and their tendons of the
index and the middle finger seemed to be united. The
inflammatory phenomena of the tendinous synovial membranes
are especially remarkable in whitlows, a disease,
one species of which has evidently its seat in the synovial
membrane of the fingers, is analogous to the inflammation
of the pleura, the peritoneum, and to that of the
articulations. It is more dangerous than the inflammation
of the synovial membranes in the form of bladders
or bags, because the fibrous sheath which surrounds the
inflamed membrane, not being able to stretch and yield
to the swelling, like the cellular texture which surrounds
the synovial bags, produces real strangulations, which it
is often necessary to remove. I do not know whether
the synovial texture of the tendons is exposed to the slow
and tubercular inflammations, common to the articular
serous and synovial systems. Its vital properties and
those of texture appear to be precisely the same as those
of this last. Like it, it receives with difficulty the sympathetic
influence of the other organs; it is unaffected
during the derangement of the other systems in acute
diseases; it remains sound in their alterations arising from
chronic affections. I would observe also that all its affections
are almost local. For example, there is not, as in
the serous system, species of dropsical diathesis, that is
to say of cases in which all the synovial sacs are filled
at the same time.</p>

<p>The tendinous synovial membranes, fine and delicate
in the fÅ“tus and in infancy, readily yield to the numerous
motions which constantly succeed that age. More
dense and compact in the adult, they become rigid in old
age, exhale less fluid, are dry, and do not contribute a
little, by the state in which they are, to the general slowness
of the motions which that age brings with it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span></p>

<p>There are many synovial membranes the existence of
which is variable; such as, for example, that of the great
glutÃ¦us, in the place of which there is often found only
a cellular mass. These membranes are in general very
dry when they exist. Synovia can scarcely be discovered
in them. They resemble in this respect the articular
synovial membranes of the vertebrÃ¦, the clavicle, &amp;c.</p>

<h2 id="GLANDULAR_SYSTEM">GLANDULAR SYSTEM.</h2>


<p>This system, one of the most important in the animal
economy, differs from most others in this, that the
texture which is peculiar to it is not precisely the same
in all the organs that compose it. The fibres of a muscle
of animal life would as well serve for the structure of
any other muscle of the same system. The tendinous
fibres, the cartilaginous, osseous textures, &amp;c. are everywhere
the same. On the contrary, the texture of the
liver would not serve to compose the kidney, nor that of
this last the salivary glands. The glandular system then
has a resemblance in its different parts only by certain
general attributes which have many exceptions.</p>

<p>Authors have given the name of glands to organs to
which it does not belong; such as the thyroid, the pineal,
the lymphatic glands, those especially that are in the
neighbourhood of the bronchia, the thymus, the suprarenal,
&amp;c. We should call by this name only a body
from which flows, by one or many ducts, a fluid which
this body separates from the blood which it receives by
the vessels that go to it. 1st. On the head, the salivary,
the lachrymal, the Meibomian and the ceruminous glands
of the ear, and the amygdalÃ¦.; 2d, the mammÃ¦ on the
thorax; 3d, in the abdomen, the liver, the pancreas and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
the kidneys; 4th, in the pelvis, the prostate and the testicles;
5th, on the whole trunk and the face, the very
numerous collection of mucous glands; these are nearly
all that are dependant upon the glandular system; all the
other organs which belong to it by this name, are foreign
to it in their texture, their properties, their life and their
functions. In this point of view, the division of Vicq
dâ€™Azyr is inaccurate.</p>

<p>The extremities contain nothing which belong to this
system, no doubt because the fluids which it separates
almost all serve for the functions of organic life, whilst in
the extremities every thing is in relation to animal functions.</p>


<hr class="chap" />

<h3>ARTICLE FIRST.<br />

<small>SITUATION, FORMS, DIVISION, &amp;c. OF THE GLANDULAR
SYSTEM.</small></h3>

<p>The glands have two different positions. Some of them
are sub-cutaneous, as the mammÃ¦, the salivary glands, &amp;c.;
the others deep seated, as the liver, the kidneys, the pancreas
and almost all the mucous ones are removed from
the action of external bodies. The greatest number occupy
places where there is constantly much motion, as
the salivary glands on account of the jaw, the mucous on
account of the neighbouring fleshy layer, the liver on account
of the diaphragm, &amp;c. It is this which has made
it believed that this motion, foreign to their functions,
was destined to produce the excretion of their fluids.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
But, 1st, the glands of the palatine arch, the pancreas, the
testicles, the kidneys even, can hardly borrow accessory
aid on account of their position. 2d. We know that the
sight alone of grateful food makes the saliva flow. 3d.
Sialagogues produce the same effect. 4th. When the
bladder is paralytic, the mucous juices pour into it as before,
oftentimes more copiously. 5th. The semen flows
involuntarily. 6th. The excretion of the mucous juices
is as easy in the pituitary membrane as any where else,
though the fleshy layer, almost everywhere spread under
the mucous system, is wholly wanting here. A thousand
other analogous facts prove this truth placed beyond a
doubt by Bordeu, viz. that the vital action is the essential
cause of every excretion.</p>

<p>Accessory aid should not however be entirely rejected.
In fact, in salivary fistulas, there is evidently more fluid
thrown out during mastication than at any other time. It
is evident that in the excretion of urine, the abdominal
muscles perform the principal part. When the gall-bladder
is emptied, I believe that the neighbouring motions
are much assistance to it. In general, whenever the
fluids are found in considerable quantities, if the parietes
of the organs which contain them are not very strong,
like those of the heart, the motions of the neighbouring
organs are necessary to overcome the resistance which
they offer. On the contrary, in the capillary vessels in
which the fluids are in small quantities, the organ that
contains them is sufficient, by its reaction, for the motion.</p>

<p>There are single glands like the liver, the pancreas,
&amp;c.; and others in pairs, as the kidneys, the salivary,
lachrymal glands, &amp;c. These resemble each other in general
on both sides; but their resemblance is not to be
compared for precision to that of the organs in pairs of
animal life. One of the kidneys is lower than the other;
their arteries, veins and nerves are not analogous either
in length or size; frequently fissures exist in one that are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
wanting in the other, &amp;c. The same observation is true
with respect to the salivary glands.</p>

<p>The glandular forms are not fixed and invariable; they
exhibit a thousand different modifications in their size,
direction and proportions; they have never the precise
and exact conformation of the organs of animal life.
This fact can be disputed by no one who has examined a
number of dead bodies. The following are the means
by which I have made this most evident to myself. We
know that the organs vary much in size, in different individuals;
now, in these varieties the proportions are
always accurately kept in animal life, whilst it is rare
that they are so in organic life. Let us take an organ for
example in each of the two lives. I have always seen
that in a small brain the corpus callosum, the thalami
nervorum opticorum, the corpora striata, &amp;c. are in proportion
to the whole size of the organ. On the contrary,
nothing is more common than to see a large lobe of Spigelius
with a small liver, and vice versa a large liver
with a small lobe. There is no anatomist who has not
had frequent occasion to make this remarkable observation.
A kidney is larger sometimes in its superior part,
sometimes in its inferior, &amp;c. It is in the whole of the
organ that these varieties of size take place in animal life;
it is oftentimes in insulated parts only in organic life.
The reason of this appears to me to be that the harmony
of action is necessary, as I have demonstrated, for the
animal functions; so that if one side of the brain is more
developed than the other, if one eye, one ear, one pituitary
membrane, &amp;c. are more developed than their corresponding
organs, the perception, the sight, the hearing,
the smell, &amp;c. would be inevitably deranged; whilst the
secretion of bile, of urine, &amp;c. takes place equally well,
though one part of these glands may be larger or smaller
than the other parts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span></p>

<p>There is a remark to be made respecting the glands
with regard to these varieties of form, it is, that those
which are covered by a membrane, as the liver, the kidneys,
even the pancreas, are less exposed to them than
those which are buried in cellular texture without having
around them a membranous covering, as the salivary, the
lachrymal, the mucous glands, &amp;c. I have often examined
these last in the mouth and in the course of the trachea;
I never found them alike in two subjects. We know
that the parotid sometimes extends upon the masseter,
and sometimes does not, that it descends more or less
into the neck, that it is of a greater or less size there, &amp;c.</p>

<p>When one gland of a pair is wanting or becomes
diseased, sometimes the other increases considerably in
size, as I have seen in the kidneys. This takes place also
in the treatment by compression of salivary fistulas, a
treatment which does not however always succeed. In
other cases, the sound gland increases its action and
secretes more fluid, without increasing in size.</p>

<p>The exterior of the glands not covered by membranes
is unequal and lobulated; it conforms to the muscles, the
vessels, the nerves, and even the bones, as the parotid
which is placed under the angle of the jaw. Less cellular
texture is in general found around them, than around
organs with great motion. That which is in contact with
them is more dense and compact than that of the organic
interstices. It closely resembles the sub-mucous texture,
that exterior to the arteries, the veins, the excretories,
&amp;c. but it is not however so resisting. It receives fat
with difficulty, and forms a kind of membrane, which,
insulating to a certain extent the vitality of the gland,
performs in great measure in this respect the functions of
the peritoneum around the liver, of the peculiar membrane
of the kidneys, the spleen, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>ARTICLE SECOND.<br />

<small>ORGANIZATION OF THE GLANDULAR SYSTEM.</small></h3>


<h4>I. <i>Texture peculiar to the Organization of this System.</i></h4>

<p>The glandular texture is distinct from most of the
others in this, that the fibrous arrangement is wholly
foreign to it. The elements that compose it are not
placed at the side of each other, in longitudinal or oblique
lines, as in the muscles, the fibrous bodies, the bones, the
nerves, &amp;c. They are found agglomerated, united by
cellular texture, and adhere but very slightly. Thus
whilst the organs with distinct fibres resist much, especially
in the direction of their fibres, these are torn with
the least effort, and break even with ease. Their rupture
is unequal, full of prominences and depressions, a
difference which distinguishes them from cartilage, the
rupture of which is in general smooth. This rupture is
not equally easy in all the glands. The prostate, the
amygdalÃ¦, the mucous glands resist much more than the
liver or the kidneys, which principally exhibit this phenomenon.
The pancreas and salivary glands yield a little
without breaking, when they are pulled; but it is not
their texture which is the seat of this phenomenon, it is
the abundant cellular texture that penetrates them; thus
their different lobes are then separated, in proportion as
the filaments which are between them become longer.</p>

<p>The glandular texture, which is very commonly called
parenchyma, is in general arranged in three different
ways. 1st. In the pancreas, the salivary and lachrymal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
glands, there are distinct lobes, separated by cellular texture,
resulting from smaller lobes which are agglomerated
together and which are composed of still less lobes, that
are called glandular grains; the scalpel traces with ease the
first, second, third and even fourth divisions. 2d. In the
liver and the kidneys there is found no trace of the first
of these divisions, of those into principal and even secondary
lobes. The glandular grains all in juxta-position,
having between them an equal quantity of cellular texture,
a quantity which is very small, as we shall see, present
an uniform texture without inequality, which is
broken with ease, as I have said, and the rupture of
which exhibits species of granulations. 3d. The prostate,
the amygdalÃ¦ and all the mucous glands have a soft
parenchyma, like pulp, without the appearance of principal
or secondary lobes, or even glandular grains, not
breaking, yielding much more under the finger that compresses
it, than that of the other glands. The simple inspection
of the glandular system is sufficient to enable
any one to perceive the triple difference which I have
just pointed out, and which is essential. The testicles
and the mammÃ¦ have a peculiar texture which cannot be
referred to these differences.</p>

<p>Authors have been much occupied with the intimate
structure of the glands. Malpighi admitted that there
were small bodies in them, which he believed were formed
of a peculiar nature. Ruysch determined that they
were all vascular. Let us neglect all these idle questions,
in which neither inspection nor experiment can guide us.
Let us begin to study anatomy where the organs can
be subjected to our senses. The exact progress of the
sciences in this age is not accommodated to all these
hypotheses, which made general anatomy and physiology
but a frivolous romance in the last.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that the excretories communicate
with the arteries which penetrate the glands. Injections<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
made in these escape with great ease by the first, without
there being any trace of extravasation in the gland.
The blood flows often naturally by the excretories, and
produces sometimes bloody urine, saliva, &amp;c. But do
these facts prove that there are only vessels in the glands,
that the peculiar parenchyma of which they are the result
does not depend on a substance which is peculiar to
them? The glands, like all the other organs, as the
muscles, the bones, the mucous membranes, &amp;c. have
their peculiar texture which especially characterizes them,
which belongs only to them, a texture in which the
arteries communicate with the veins and the excretories.
Let us not push our researches further; if we do, we
shall be inevitably entangled in conjectures. Let us confine
ourselves to examining what phenomena distinguish
this texture from all the others when subjected to the
different reagents. It is much to know the characteristic
attributes of the glandular system, without seeking to understand
its intimate nature, which, like that of all the
other systems, is concealed by an impenetrable veil.</p>

<p>The glandular parenchyma dried in the air after having
been cut in slices, loses its original colour, takes a
deep one, black even in the liver and the kidneys, in
which it is owing especially to the blood which penetrates
these glands, since if they are dried after having
been deprived of it by repeated washing, they remain
grey after their drying. No system becomes harder or
more brittle than this by this preparation. It diminishes
then less in size than most of the others. When immersed
in water after being thus dried, it becomes soft,
resumes in part its original appearance and its tendency to
putrefaction, which takes place immediately if it is left
in the open air.</p>

<p>The glandular texture, when exposed to the air so that
it does not dry, becomes putrid very quickly, and gives
out an odour more fetid than most of the others. More<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
ammonia appears to be disengaged from it. The liver
especially produces an insupportable odour when putrid.
I do not know any organ, kept in a vessel full of water
to macerate, which gives out more disagreeable emanations.
The kidney becomes putrid much less quickly;
this varies however a little.</p>

<p>When boiled, the glandular texture furnishes in the
first moments of ebullition, a great quantity of grey substance,
which mixes at first perfectly with the water
which it renders turbid and then collects into a copious
scum on the top of this fluid. It is this texture, the
fleshy, the mucous and the cellular which give the most
scum in boiling, as it is the cartilaginous, the tendinous,
the aponeurotic, the fibro-cartilaginous, &amp;c. which give
the least of it. It should not be believed, moreover, that
this first product of stewing is uniform in its nature; it
varies in each system in quality as well as quantity. At
least I have observed that its appearance is never the
same, that it has nothing constant but its frothy state,
which also varies much and which is even almost always
nothing in the mucous system.</p>

<p>The liquor which results from the boiling is very much
changed in colour, and appears to contain many more
principles than that made with the white organs. An
accurate analysis of the liquor in which each system had
been boiled would be an interesting subject of research.
I have found that in almost all the appearance, the taste
and the colour were different.</p>

<p>The glands exhibit a phenomenon when cooking that
especially distinguishes them. They harden at the moment
of the first ebullition, and acquire the horny hardness
like all the other systems; but whilst most of these
soften again from long-continued stewing, so as to become
pulpy, the glands uniformly become harder, so that after
five or six hours boiling, they are three or four times as
hard as they naturally are. I have very often made this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
experiment, which is also well known in our kitchens, in
which when a gland is cooked, care is taken that the
stewing should not continue too long. Beef kidney
finally becomes soft; those of sheep and of man remain
hard for a much longer time. They soften however more
than the texture of the liver, which is of all the glands
that which exhibits the hardness in the greatest degree.</p>

<p>Another phenomenon which especially distinguishes
the ebullition of the glandular system, is that when it is
taken out at the moment it has undergone the sudden
horny hardening, common to almost all the animal solids
plunged into boiling water, it has not like the others acquired
elasticity. Draw in an opposite direction a tendon,
a serous or mucous membrane or a muscle that have
undergone the horny hardening, they stretch and afterwards
suddenly contract the instant the extension ceases;
on the contrary, a slice of liver that has the horny hardness
breaks when it is drawn and never contracts. The
texture of the prostate appears to be more capable of then
acquiring a little elasticity. The non-fibrous disposition
of the glands seems to have much influence upon
this phenomenon.</p>

<p>Exposed to the sudden action of a very bright fire as
in roasting, the texture of the liver and the other glands
crisps and contracts on the exterior. There results from
it on the surface a kind of covering impermeable in part
to the juices contained in the organ, which in this way
becomes cooked in these juices which soften it in the interior.
This phenomenon is however common to all the
solids. Hence why care is taken to expose what is roasting,
whether it be muscular or glandular, at first to the
action of a very quick fire; afterwards when the horny
hardening of the surface has been produced, it is diminished,
and the organ is cooked with a small fire.</p>

<p>The glands macerated in water yield differently to its
action. The liver resists it longer than the kidney,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
which after an experiment of two months made in vessels
placed in a cellar has been reduced to a reddish jelly
swimming in the water; whilst the first preserved for
the same time and a little longer, its form and density,
and had only changed its red colour to a blueish brown,
whereas the kidney retains its colour in maceration. The
salivary glands contain much of this white, unctuous and
hard substance, which all the cellular parts when long
macerated exhibit. It is not the glandular texture that
has changed, but only the fat contained in the cellular
texture, which is here very abundant.</p>

<p>The acids act upon the glandular texture nearly the
same as upon all the others. They reduce them to a pulp
which varies in its colour and the rapidity of its formation,
according to the acid employed. The sulphuric is
uniformly the most efficacious in producing this pulp
which it blackens, whilst the nitric yellows it. All the
acids act with much more difficulty upon the glandular
texture when stewed, than when raw. My experiments
have convinced me that but few systems exhibit this difference
in a more remarkable manner.</p>

<p>The glands are much less digestible than many other
animal substances, especially when stewed, which produces
in them in this respect an effect entirely different
from what it does in the cartilages, the tendons, and all
the fibrous organs, which by it lose their density, become
soft, gelatinous, viscid even and are easier dissolved
by the gastric juice. I believe in general that we should
digest the glands much easier by eating them raw.
Every one knows that the more the liver is cooked, the
more indigestible it becomes. This induced me to make
a comparative experiment upon this organ cooked and
raw; when one portion in the second state was reduced
to a pulp in the stomach of a dog, the other portion in
the first state swallowed at the same time had just begun
to be altered.</p>

<h5><i>Of the Excretories, of their Origin, of their Divisions,
&amp;c. Of the Glandular Reservoirs.</i></h5>

<p>All the glands have ducts destined to carry off the fluid
which they secrete from the mass of blood; now as they
are only found in the glands, they should be considered
with the peculiar texture of these organs. The origin
of these ducts is uniform in all the glands. They arise,
like the veins, by an infinite number of capillaries, which
form the last ramifications of a kind of tree, these ramifications
appear to begin at each glandular grain, where
these grains exist; so that for each there is one of these,
an artery and a vein. Arising thus from the whole of the
interior of the gland, these ducts soon unite and form
larger ducts, which usually go in a straight line though
the glandular texture, converge towards each other, unite
with other ducts still larger and terminate differently.</p>

<p>In respect to this termination, glands should be divided
into three classes. 1st. Some transmit their fluids by
many ducts, each of which is the assemblage of smaller
ducts, opening at the side of each other, but all entirely
distinct and without communication. Sometimes at the
place where these ducts terminate, a more or less considerable
prominence is observed, as on the breast, as also
on the prostate, of which the verumontanum is a kind of
nipple. Sometimes there is a depression, a sort of cul-de-sac
which is found at the place of these orifices, as in
the amygdalÃ¦, upon the tongue, &amp;c. Sometimes the surface
on which the different ducts of a gland open, is
smooth and even, as is the case with that on which those
of the lachrymal, sublingual and almost all the mucous
glands open. 2d. Other glands pour out their fluid by a
single duct, as the parotids, the pancreas, the sublinguals,
&amp;c.; this arrangement is only a modification of the preceding;
where the duct opens, no inequality is usually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
discovered, the surface is smooth. 3d. There are glands
which, before throwing out their fluid by their excretories,
deposit it for some time in a reservoir where it
remains to be afterwards expelled; such as the kidneys,
the liver, the testicles, &amp;c. Here there are always two
excretories, one which goes from the gland to the reservoir,
the other from the reservoir outwards. These reservoirs
are evidently a part of the same system to which
their excretory ducts belong.</p>

<p>Though the first and second species of glands have no
reservoir, yet the different ramifications of their excretories
may to a certain extent be considered as such. In
fact, these ramifications, as well as those of the excretories
of the glands with a reservoir, are constantly full
of the fluid which is secreted in these organs. Whatever
may have been the kind of death, the fluid of the prostate
may be always made to ooze out, by compressing the
gland; I have often even by pressure produced a very
evident jet. The papillÃ¦ of the kidney also uniformly
give out urine when pressed. The liver cut in slices
allows natural bile to escape from the divisions of the
hepatic duct. The semen is uniformly found in the windings
of the vas deferens. The lactiferous vessels keep the
milk in their cavity, till it is evacuated, and it has even
no other reservoir. The greater or less size of the mammÃ¦
during lactation is owing to the greater or less fulness
of these vessels. It is also to this circumstance that must
be referred the peculiar taste of each glandular texture,
which always borrows some sapid particles from the fluid
it secretes. We know that the kidney has always an
urinous odour, especially in old animals. It is to this
also that I refer the difference of putrefaction which I
have observed between this organ and the liver. We
know that the bile undergoes putrid fermentation sooner
than the urine; this, when it is very acid, can even preserve
it to a certain extent from putrefaction; expose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
then the liver and the kidney to it, the latter will almost
always be the last to become putrid, as I have said.</p>

<p>It appears in general that the course of the fluids in
the excretories is much less rapid than that of the blood
in the veins and even than that of the lymph in the absorbents;
the following considerations place this beyond
a doubt. The urine flows continually by the ureters, as
is evidently proved by fistulas in the loins; now, in the
time taken to fill the bladder by this uninterrupted flowing,
there would flow from a vein of a diameter equal to
that of the ureter ten times as much blood, and much
more lymph from the thoracic duct. Yet this rapidity of
motion is subject to many varieties; during the period of
inactivity of the glands, it is not half as great as during
their activity; the salivary fistulas are a proof of this.
We know how promptly the ureters transmit the urine
from the drinks that are taken.</p>


<h5><i>Size, Direction and Termination of the Excretories.</i></h5>

<p>The size of the excretories varies. 1st. Those which
go out in considerable number from a gland are very
small, often hardly perceptible. They commonly run
their course in a straight line, do not anastomose with
each other and open immediately upon going out of the
gland. 2d. Those that are single are larger, always in
proportion to the size of their gland, except however the
hepatic which is evidently very small in comparison with
the liver. They run their course out of their glands, and
arise from ducts as large as those of the preceding ones;
so that if a single trunk arose from the excretories of
these, they would resemble the others in every respect.
They differ only in this, that their secondary excretories
open directly on their surface, whereas they unite in a
common trunk in the others. The pancreas is the only
one in which this common trunk goes concealed in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
gland itself. It is only in the testicles that it is tortuous,
and in which, on this account, it is longer than the course
which it has to run.</p>

<p>Whatever may be their arrangement, the excretories
pour all their fluid either on the exterior, as the urethra,
and ureters, the lactiferous tubes, and the ducts of the
sebaceous glands; or on the interior of the mucous membranes,
as the mucous, salivary, pancreatic, prostate and
hepatic excretories. The cutaneous and mucous surfaces
are the only ones then on which the excretories terminate,
the only ones which their fluids moisten. These
ducts are never seen opening upon the serous or synovial
surfaces. The excretories of the pretended articular glands
would be, if they existed, an exception to the laws of the
general organization. The excretories never open in the
cellular texture; if this happens preternaturally, either
abscesses take place from the irritation which results from
it, as in urinary fistulas, or a callus forms in the course of
the excreted fluid, and thus defend the cellular system
from a troublesome infiltration.</p>

<p>Hence the mucous tube of the intestines should be considered
as a kind of general excretory added to the pancreatic,
hepatic excretories, &amp;c. and which throws out
all the fluids which are separately poured by these ducts
into it. In fact, all the secreted fluids appear to be destined,
as I have said, to be thrown out of the body.
Separated from the mass of blood, they are foreign to it,
and do not enter it in a natural state. Though still contained
in cavities with mucous surfaces, they may be
truly considered as being out of our parts. These surfaces
are really true internal integuments, destined to defend
the organs from the contact of the substances which
they contain, a contact which would inevitably be injurious
to them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span></p>


<h5><i>Remarks on the Secreted Fluids.</i></h5>

<p>The fact that the secreted fluids are destined to be
thrown out, a fact which is incontestable with regard to
the urine, the bile which colours the excrements, the
saliva, &amp;c. has made me for a long time believe that the
introduction of these fluids into the sanguineous system,
would produce the most serious consequences. I was besides
confirmed in this, 1st, by my experiments, in which I
have always seen, as I have said, the urine, the bile, &amp;c.
injected into the cellular texture, remain without being
absorbed, but producing abscesses; 2d, by the infiltration
of the urine in the neighbourhood of the bladder,
from which abscesses always arise; 3d, by the serious
consequences from the effusions of this fluid in the peritoneum
from the high operation for the stone, and of the
bile on the same surface in certain penetrating wounds,
in both these cases these fluids never re-enter the blood
by way of absorption, like the peritoneal serum, but almost
always occasion death; 4th, by an experiment in which
I had seen a dog die shortly after the injection of urine
into the jugular. All these considerations made me suspect
that the secreted fluids, introduced again into the
mass of blood, were always fatal at the end of some time,
and that, as some physicians whose opinion is of great
weight have thought, all that has been said of the bileâ€™s
being poured into the blood in bilious diseases, is but a
consequence of vague ideas of the reality of which there is
no proof. Yet the importance of this question, in regard
to medical theories, has induced me to resolve it by
experiments, so as to leave no doubt upon the subject.</p>

<p>I have then injected into the jugular veins of many
dogs bile taken from the gall-bladder of other dogs which
I opened at the same time. For the first few days they
appeared to be weary, did not eat, were much altered,
their eyes were heavy, and they were constantly lying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
down; but after some time they gradually regained their
former vigour. I afterwards employed human bile in
these experiments; the result was the same, except that
many times, the animal had hiccough and vomiting some
time after the injection. In one instance a dog died in
three hours after the experiment; but it was because I
made use of that extremely black fluid that is sometimes
found in the gall-bladder instead of bile which resembles
thick ink, and which appears to form a considerable part
of those black vomitings that sometimes take place.</p>

<p>These experiments induced me to try some with the
saliva, and I obtained the same result from them; only the
languid state that succeeded the injection was less evident.
I afterwards made use of nasal mucus suspended in a
sufficient quantity of water, for it can hardly be dissolved
in it. Finally urine itself was many times injected, not
that which comes immediately from drink and is only
aqueous, but that which is of slow formation. In this
experiment the dogs have been sicker, but only one died,
and that happened on the seventh day. I have many
times repeated it, on account of that which I performed
three years ago; the same result has always taken place,
which makes me think that being but little used at that
time to make experiments, I introduced by accident a
bubble of air through the syringe, which is sufficient to
produce the death of the animal.</p>

<p>A question then is evidently settled by the experiment.
The secreted fluids, though destined to be thrown out in
the natural state, can re-enter the circulation, without
causing the death of the animal, which is only more or
less affected according to the nature of the fluid injected.
Whether the bile circulates or not with the blood in
bilious fevers, I have not examined; but it certainly can
circulate with it after having been absorbed in its canals.
I do not doubt but that in purulent reabsorptions, the pus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
circulates in its natural state in the sanguineous system;
I confess that I have not made experiments upon the
injection of this fluid, but I intend to immediately.</p>

<p>We exaggerate every thing. No doubt the solids in
which the vital forces are especially inherent, are particularly
affected in diseases; but why should not the fluids
be affected also? Why should we not seek in them causes
of disease as well as in the solids?</p>

<p>There are cases in which these are primarily affected,
and in which the fluids are so in consequence; thus in
cancer, in the affections of the liver, the spleen, &amp;c. in
most organic lesions, the various yellowish, grey, brown
and even greenish shades of the face, are an index of the
consecutive alterations which the fluids experience in
their colour and consequently in their nature.</p>

<p>In other cases the affection commences with them; as
when the venom of the viper is introduced into the blood,
as when reabsorption of pus takes place from external
abscesses, or in phthisis, and as when there is absorption
of various contagious principles. There is no doubt that
the different substances which can be introduced with the
chyle into the blood, may be the cause of various diseases.
Is it not the blood which carries to the brain the
narcotic principles which produce sleep? does it not
carry turpentine and cantharides to the kidneys, mercury
to the salivary glands, &amp;c.? Inject opium, wine, &amp;c. into
the veins, and you will stupify the animal the same as if
you had given them by the stomach.</p>

<p>Physiologists at one time were much engaged with the
introduction of medicinal infusions into the veins of living
animals. They circulated by these infusions purgatives,
emetics and a thousand other foreign substances, the contact
of which the blood bore, without occasioning any
other accident to the animal than that of vomiting or
alvine evacuations if they were emetics or purgatives, and
a greater or less general derangement if they were other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
foreign substances which had no affinity with any particular
organ.</p>

<p>The caustics, as the nitric and sulphuric acids and other
very irritating substances, have alone caused death in
these curious experiments of which Haller has given us
a sketch, and which prove that various substances wholly
foreign to the blood can circulate in it, and that it is a
common mass in which are found many principles differing
from each other, and which cannot be always essentially
the same. In these experiments the most important
part has been neglected, that of the infusion of the
different animal fluids, particularly the secreted ones, and
those also which are preternaturally produced in diseases.
I think that the different reabsorptions would be much
elucidated by the infusion of the various kinds of pus,
sanies, &amp;c. But we have already sufficient facts to convince
us that the fluids and especially the blood can be
diseased; that the various foreign substances mixed with
it can act in a fatal manner upon the solids. In fact, every
acrid, irritating matter, without being mortal, accelerates
the action of the heart and produces a true fever, if injected
into the veins. In all these cases, it is always necessary
that the solids should act; for all the morbid phenomena
suppose their alterations; but the principle of these alterations
is in the fluids. They are the excitants, and the
solids the organs excited. Now if there are no excitants,
there is no excitement, and the solids remain unaffected.</p>

<p>Finally there are cases in which the whole economy
both solids and fluids seem to be simultaneously affected;
such are adynamic fevers, in which at the same time that
there is a general prostration of the first, the second appear
to be really decomposed.</p>

<p>Let us not exaggerate then medical theories; let us
regard nature in diseases as she is in a state of health, in
which the solids elaborate the fluids and are at the same
time excited by them. There is a reciprocal action,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
every thing succeeds each other, every thing is connected
together. Our abstractions hardly ever exist in nature.
We usually adopt a certain number of general principles
in medicine, and we accustom ourselves afterwards to deduce
from these principles, as necessary consequences, all
the explanations of diseases. There is in physical phenomena
a regularity and uniformity which never deceive.
In morals even, there is a certain number of principles
acknowledged by all men, which direct them and regulate
their actions; hence a constant uniformity in our
manner of considering moral and physical phenomena;
hence the habit of going always from the same principles
in reasoning upon them. We have carried this habit into
the study of the living economy, without considering
that it incessantly varies its phenomena, that under the
same circumstances they are hardly ever the same, that
they are continually increased and diminished and have a
thousand different modifications. Nature seems at every
instant to be irregular, capricious and inconsequent in
their production, because the essence of the laws which
preside over these phenomena, is not the same as that of
the physical laws.</p>

<p>I would observe that the experiments the result of
which I have just given for the secreted fluids, differ
from those which I published the last year, and in which
these fluids have always been fatal, the instant they were
forced towards the brain by the carotid. This is a phenomenon
general to all the irritating fluids, whether drawn
from the economy, or foreign to it; they destroy life
when they arrive at the cerebral organ, by a direct injection
and without having undergone any alteration,
whilst we can inject them with impunity into the veins,
as the experiments of the physicians of the last age have
proved. We can even without danger, as I have observed,
introduce them into the arterial system, on the side
opposite to the brain, as in the crural artery, for example.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
Do the fluids mixed with the black blood rid themselves
of some principles by respiration, before they arrive at
the brain, or is the preceding phenomenon owing to other
causes? I know not. I would only observe that every
thing which is not arterial blood, as the black blood and
even serum, produces death when forced into the carotid.
Water alone is injected with impunity. When the irritating
principles are much diluted in this fluid, their contact
is less injurious. I have seen very light coloured
urine not produce death.</p>


<h5><i>Structure of the Excretories.</i></h5>

<p>All the excretories have an internal membrane which
is mucous, and which is a continuation of the mucous or
cutaneous surfaces, upon which they terminate. But besides
this, they all exhibit an external covering which
forms the shell, as it were, of this mucous canal. This
shell is very thick in the vas deferens, in which it exhibits
a texture but little known. In the urethra it is
of a spongy nature, containing much blood and analogous
to the glans of which it is a continuation. In the ureters,
in the hepatic, salivary ducts, &amp;c. it is this extremely
dense and compact cellular texture of which we have
spoken, which, by its structure, resembles that of the
arterial and venous cellular texture, and which differs essentially
from the ordinary cellular texture, as from the
intermuscular. It does not appear that there is in these
ducts a membrane differing from this dense texture and
the mucous surface.</p>

<p>Each excretory has its vessels. The ureters evidently
receive branches from the renal, spermatic arteries, &amp;c.
&amp;c. The hepatic gives them to the ductus choledochus;
the transverse artery of the face supplies the duct of Steno.
Various nerves coming from the ganglions accompany the
corresponding arteries and veins. Yet I have uniformly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
observed that there is never around these ducts a plexus
as evident as there is around most of the arteries.</p>

<p>The excretories have principally the vital properties
of the mucous system which forms them in great part.
Their sympathies are also nearly of the same nature.</p>


<h4>II. <i>Parts common to the Organization of the Glandular
System. Cellular Texture.</i></h4>

<p>The glands differ much in the cellular texture which
enters into their structure. We may even, in this respect,
divide them into two classes.</p>

<p>In all the salivary glands, in the lachrymal, in the pancreas,
in all the glands with a granulated and white parenchyma,
it is very abundant. Each glandular body is divided
into lobes very distinctly separated by grooves which
this texture fills, and which produce the lobulated appearance
on the exterior of this species of gland; not only each
lobe, but each lobule, each glandular grain even, has also
the cellular texture for a boundary. In this respect, this
sort of gland is truly an assemblage of small distinct
bodies, which, separated from each other, would also
perform well their functions. This is what is seen in the
parotids, in which different accessory glands are often
found in the course of the duct of Steno, and are perfectly
independent of the principal gland. Sometimes there
is a continuity, sometimes there is a separation between
the sub-maxillary and the sub-lingual glands. The cellular
texture is often loaded with much fat in this species
of gland. This is especially remarkable in the mammÃ¦,
the size of which is owing sometimes to the glandular
texture, as in young people in whom this texture predominates
over the fat; sometimes to the predominance of this
fat, as we see after the fortieth year, when this gland
preserves a considerable size. The difference is easily
perceived by the touch by the softness and flaccidity of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
the organ in the second case, and by its resistance and
firmness in the first. In the age of puberty often, it is
also the fatty cellular texture which increases the size of
this organ. Hence why there is often but little milk
from a large breast, and a much greater quantity from a
smaller one. In the voluptuous sensations which we
experience at the sight of this organ, we distinguish very
well, without being conscious of it, the breast whose prominence
is real, from that which is not, and in which the
fat only raises the skin of the breast. It is rare in the
salivary glands, the pancreas, &amp;c. that the cellular texture
predominates so much, that the fat accumulates in them
in so considerable a quantity. I have however seen cases
in which the parotid resembled a fatty muscle; but there
was no increase of size.</p>

<p>In the testicle, whose parenchymatous portions are
separated as in the preceding glands, the cellular texture
is not the medium of union. There is found between
each grain species of threads which appear to be excretories,
and not real cellular laminÃ¦.</p>

<p>In the glands with a compact parenchyma, as the liver,
the kidney, the prostate, the mucous glands, &amp;c. &amp;c. there
is very little cellular texture; by tearing them in different
directions, they break without exhibiting intermediate
laminÃ¦. Fat is never found accumulated in their parenchyma.
The fatty state of the liver which takes place in
many diseases, and which is not, as has been thought, an
affection necessarily attendant upon phthisis, exhibits a
phenomenon wholly different from the mammÃ¦ and the
salivary glands when they have become fatty. The fat
enters then like an element into the texture of the organ;
it is in this respect like the colouring substance, whose
place it has as it were taken; it is not found in cells.
Moreover much of it can be extracted by ebullition, and I
have observed that much of it swims on the surface of
the water in which livers of this kind are boiled. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
kidney also has fat in its interior; but it is around the
pelvis and not in its peculiar parenchyma. The amygdalÃ¦,
the prostate, the mucous glands, &amp;c. never have it.
Serum is never effused into the texture of the glands with
a compact parenchyma. The most complete leucophlegmasia
leaves them sound in this respect.</p>

<p>Yet it cannot be doubted that the cellular texture exists
in these glands; maceration demonstrates it in them. In
the fungous tumours that grow out of them, there is much
of it. It is principally around the vessels that it is found;
the capsule of Glisson is an example of this. It often
happens even, as I have been led to observe, that this
texture becomes diseased, whilst that of the gland remains
sound. Thus we see steatomatous tumours developed in
the liver, serous cysts in the kidney, hydatids in both,
and various productions in the other glands, without
deranging the secretion in the least. It is upon the liver
especially that these observations are best made; its size
is trebled, even often quadrupled by internal tumours,
without an increase of its texture; this texture dilated
forms between these tumours, species of partitions in
which the bile is secreted as usual. The same thing takes
place in the kidney, in which serous cysts are found.
Sometimes these cysts grow there till the whole glandular
texture is destroyed, and there remains only a large
sac separated by membranous partitions, and filled with
serum. I have preserved three kidneys of this kind.</p>


<h5><i>Blood Vessels.</i></h5>

<p>All the glands not covered by a membrane, receive their
arteries from all sides. Numerous branches coming from
the neighbouring vessels, penetrate the whole surface of
the pancreas, the salivary and lachrymal glands, &amp;c.
These arteries wind at first in the interstices between the
lobes, ramify afterwards between the smaller lobes and
finally penetrate the glandular grains. Each of them has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
its own artery; all communicate together; so that those
of the sub-maxillary and the sub-lingual are filled by injection
made by means of small tubes into the sub-mental,
the external maxillary or the lingual, as well as by an injection
of the trunk even of the external carotid.</p>

<p>In the glands surrounded by a membrane, as the liver,
the kidney, the testicle, &amp;c. the arteries enter only at one
side, usually in a fissure, and by a single trunk which is
very considerable, and which is sometimes divided into
many branches more or less large. This part of the gland
in which the artery enters is always the most distant from
the action of external bodies, a remark common to all the
important organs, as the lungs, the intestines, the spleen,
&amp;c. which always present externally their convex surface,
that on which the vessels are the most ramified; so
that the place where an injury can happen to them is
that where hemorrhage is the least to be feared. The
principal artery, after it has entered the gland, is soon
divided into different branches which separate and are
subdivided as they approach the convexity. They give
off in their course many branches to the body of the gland
and then terminate by a great number of capillaries on
the convex part of the gland. They often even pierce
the organ and ramify between it and the membrane which
covers it. For example, by injecting the hepatic artery,
if the liver is bare, many small blackish striÃ¦ suddenly
appear on its convexity, which are owing to this cause.
The best means of seeing the glandular arterial system,
is to inject a kidney with a solid substance, and afterwards
destroy its parenchyma by maceration or something
else. The arterial system is then bare and entirely
by itself. Many of these preparations are found in anatomical
museums.</p>

<p>The great arterial trunks winding in the glands, communicate
to them an internal motion very favourable to
their functions. This motion is so much the more evi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>dent,
as almost all these organs very near the heart by
their position in the trunk, are, if we may so say, under
the immediate jar of its contractions. The salivary glands,
the mucous ones of the mouth and the lachrymal on the
one hand, the testicle, the prostate and the mucous ones
of the genital parts on the other, exhibit the extremes of
this position. Another cause which favours the jar of
the glands by the entrance of the blood, is that almost all
the arteries that go to them run but a very short course
before they enter them. The spermatic alone is an exception
to this rule; thus, every thing in the secretion of
semen seems to be characterized by a remarkable slowness.
To this constant motion imparted to the glands by
the entrance of the blood, should be added that which is
communicated to them by the neighbouring organs, and
which keeps them in a constant excitement, which is
more necessary to their secretion than to their excretion.
In considering the action of organs, the constant motions
with which they are agitated has been too much neglected.
The example of the brain ought however to fix the
attention of physiologists upon this point.</p>

<p>The veins, everywhere continuous with the arteries,
follow the same distribution in the glandular system, and
accompany them almost everywhere. We do not see
superficial and deep-seated veins, as we do in many other
organs. The liver is the only example in which the
red blood enters at one side, and the black goes out at
the opposite.</p>

<p>Most of the veins of the glandular system pour their
blood into the general system of black blood, and as many
glands are very near the heart, they feel the reflux which
this system often experiences. This phenomenon is particularly
remarkable in the liver, as the hepatic veins
open but very little below the right auricle. Hence why
whenever this auricle is considerably distended, as in
asphyxia and in death in which the lungs being crowded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
present an obstacle to the blood, the liver has a much
greater quantity than usual. I have uniformly made this
observation. Weigh comparatively this organ when the
auricle is full and when it is empty in the dead body,
after having first tied all its vessels; you will find a very
great difference. For the same reason, you will observe
a constant relation between the weight of the liver and
that of the lungs, provided a morbid alteration of texture
of one of them be not the cause of death. The veins
of many glands, as those of the mucous ones of the
stomach and the intestines, as those of the prostate, &amp;c.
pour their blood into the system of abdominal black
blood. There are hardly any in the system of which
we are treating, but these veins, those especially of the
glands situated in the pelvis, which become varicose.
Varices of the prostate are frequent, as we know.</p>


<h5><i>Of the Blood of the Glands.</i></h5>

<p>The quantity of blood that is constantly found in the
glands varies remarkably; they may even be divided in
this respect into three classes. 1st. In the pancreas, the
salivary, lachrymal glands, &amp;c. there is found but very
little. It does not furnish the colouring matter to these
organs, which are white, and which, when macerated,
tinge with red but two or three waters. 2d. In the mucous
glands, the prostate, the testicles, and the amygdalÃ¦,
there is found a little more. 3d. The liver and the
kidneys contain so great a quantity of it, that there is not
in this respect any proportion between them and the rest
of the glandular system. This is owing in a small degree
in the first to the cause pointed out above; thus it often
contains more than the second, but it is not the essential
cause. After death by hemorrhage in which there was
no reflux, in the liver or the kidney suddenly taken from
a living animal, &amp;c. we observe the same thing. In
macerating these glands, it is necessary to renew the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
water at least a dozen times before it ceases to be bloody.
Hence why when they are preserved in alkohol on
account of an organic disease of which they were the
seat, they must be first macerated for a long time; if not,
the liquor soon becomes turbid from the blood. It is
this quantity of blood which gives to these glands a
greater weight in proportion than that of the other parts.
It is from this that their redness is derived, a colour
which no other part exhibits to the same degree, but
which is not more strongly inherent in their texture, than
it is in the mucous surfaces or the muscles. In fact, we
remove it with the same ease by repeated washing. Then
the liver assumes a greyish appearance, which appears to
be the colour inherent in its texture, as white is that of
the fleshy fibre. The kidney seems a little less to derive
its colour from the blood. It remains in part red when
macerated; the pulp even which is the product of it,
after remaining some months in water, that has been often
changed, still exhibits in some degree this colour, much
less however than in a natural state.</p>

<p>Does the state of the secretions make the quantity of the
glandular blood vary? Does more of this fluid enter the
kidney when it furnishes much urine, than when it
secretes but little, or if the same quantity is brought by
the arteries, is less returned by the veins in the first than
the second case? This is an interesting subject for experiment.</p>

<p>Is the nature of the blood changed when it arrives at
the glands? Has it a peculiar composition before entering
each of them? Much has been said of this change
necessary to secretion; but that this may take place, there
must be a cause to produce it; now what is this cause
here? Does not the blood circulate in the trunks which
go to the glands, as in the others? It would be necessary
then that the gland should be surrounded with an atmosphere
which acts upon the blood at a certain distance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
from the place where it is; a vague idea, which has no
solid foundation, and which is met with only in the books
of those who have never made experiments. I have
drawn blood from the carotid, spermatic, hepatic and
renal arteries; it is equally red and coagulable. In the
same animal, it is impossible for the senses to discover
the least difference.</p>

<p>I would observe that secretion differs essentially from
nutrition in this, that it always draws the materials of
its fluids from the red blood, whereas the second often
takes its own from the white fluids, as we see in the tendons,
the cartilages, the hair, &amp;c.</p>


<h5><i>Nerves.</i></h5>

<p>The glands receive two species of nerves. 1st. The
cerebral are found almost exclusively in the salivary and
lachrymal glands, the amygdalÃ¦, &amp;c. 2d. The testicles,
the prostate gland and the liver receive them in an almost
equal proportion from the brain and the ganglions.
3d. The kidneys and most of the mucous glands receive
scarcely any but those of the ganglions. What is now
said of the nerves should be understood only of those
that are free and independent of the arteries; for each
arterial trunk that enters a gland, is surrounded by a
nervous net-work belonging to the system of the ganglions,
which is very evident in the great glands, as in the
liver and the kidneys where this net-work comes from
the semilunar ganglion, in the salivary glands where it
comes from the superior cervical, in the testicles where
it comes from the lumbar ganglions, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Compared with the size of the glands, the nerves are
in small proportion, notwithstanding what Bordeu has
said. It is not necessary in fact to judge of this proportion
by those of the parotid and sub-maxillary glands,
which merely pass through these glands without stopping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
in them, and leave only some branches there. For example,
there is certainly no organ in the economy, among
those which receive nerves, that, in proportion to its size,
has so few as the liver.</p>

<p>Besides, the nerves enter the glands nearly in the same
way as the blood-vessels, that is to say, 1st, on all sides,
in those that have no membrane; 2d, by a groove only in
those that are covered with one. They divide and subdivide
after entering it, and are soon lost sight of. Ganglions
never exist in the interior of the glands.</p>

<p>Have the nerves an influence upon secretion? It is
probable they have, as every gland is provided with
them; but they by no means exert so immediate an influence
upon this function as many physicians have pretended.
1st. It is said that the nerves of the parotid
glands have been cut, and that the secretion of the saliva
has been suppressed. This division is evidently impossible,
since the gland must be extirpated before removing
its nerves. 2d. I have divided the nerves of the testicle
of a dog, the only gland in which this experiment can be
made. I could not obtain any result, because an inflammation
of the gland came on and it suppurated; but this
suppuration even supposes that the nervous influx is not
actually necessary for secretion, since suppuration is accomplished
by a mechanism analogous to that of this
function. All physicians know that a paralyzed limb can
inflame and suppurate. 3d. Erection and the ejection of
semen take place in paralysis of the lower half of the
body, in which at least the nerves of the prostate gland
are completely paralyzed. Mr. Ivan related to me the
case of a soldier who took gonorrhÅ“a in this state. 4th.
We know that when the bladder is perfectly paralyzed
and its nerves have no longer any action, its mucous
glands still continue to secrete their fluid so as even to
produce a catarrh. 5th. The nostril of the affected side
in hemiplegia is as moist as usual. The ear of this side<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
has its ordinary quantity of wax. 6th. In paralysis of
the uvula, the action of its glands continues. 7th.
When the eighth pair of one side of a dog is cut, the
bronchia is found some days after to contain as much
mucus as common. 8th. During the convulsions of the
different parts in which there are glands, and when consequently
the nerves of these glands are more excited, their
secretion is not increased. 9th. If we weigh the proofs
given by Bordeu of the influence of the nerves on secretions,
we shall see, that they either rest upon false facts,
like those of the section of the nerve, of sleep, &amp;c. or
upon vague data. In general physicians attach no precise
idea to the term <i>nervous influence</i>; the habit of experimenting
shows how much they have abused it. When
a nerve being cut, paralyzed or irritated in any manner,
the organ which receives it undergoes no derangement in
its functions, we certainly are unable to appreciate the
nervous influence upon this organ. I do not say that
it does not exist, but I maintain that we know nothing
about it, and that we ought not to employ at hazard a
word to which we cannot attach any precise idea. What
word will you employ then to express the influence of
the nerves upon the organs of the senses, upon the voluntary
muscles, &amp;c. if the same one is used to express an
action which has no relation with this, and which perhaps
even does not exist?</p>


<h5><i>Exhalants and Absorbents.</i></h5>

<p>This kind of vessels is but little known in the interior
of the glands, where they perform only the purposes of
nutrition.</p>

<h3>ARTICLE THIRD.<br />

<small>PROPERTIES OF THE GLANDULAR SYSTEM.</small></h3>


<h4>I. <i>Properties of Texture.</i></h4>

<p>These properties are in general very inconsiderable in
this system, which appears to me to be particularly owing
to its non-fibrous texture. In fact, in order to be elongated
and afterwards contracted and preserve their integrity,
it is necessary that the particles of an organ should
possess a certain degree of adhesion and cohesion; now,
it is to the fibre that especially belongs this double attribute.
Observe also that the glandular system is subjected
to much less frequent causes of distension and
contraction, than the systems with distinct fibres. It
is scarcely ever found distended except when purulent
deposits, serous, steatomatous collections, &amp;c. are
formed in its interior, as often happens in the middle of
the liver, kidney, &amp;c.; now in these cases it does not
yield like the skin, the muscles, &amp;c.; its particles are
separated; it is the cellular texture with which they are
surrounded that is uniformly dilated; the glandular texture
is even soon destroyed. It is very evident when
the collections are formed near the convexity of the
glands; if the tumour be at all large the texture of the
organ disappears; there remains only a cellular and membranous
cyst. Hydatids so frequent on the exterior of
the kidneys present us with examples of it. If it is in
the middle of the gland that the cyst is formed, the destruction
also takes place, but it is much less evident.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span></p>

<p>A strong proof of the small degree of extensibility of
the glands, is what takes place in the liver in dead bodies.
I have said above that it is more or less loaded with
blood, according as the system with black blood had been
more or less embarrassed in the last moments. Now
whatever may be the quantity of blood it contains, its
size remains nearly the same; only its texture is more or
less compressed by the vessels, whilst on the contrary
the greater or less size of the lungs, which is very apparent,
always indicates its state of fulness or vacuity. It
is probable even that it is this difference which has made
all physicians neglect the infinitely various states of engorgement
in which the liver may be found at death,
whilst they have had a particular regard to the varieties
of the lungs.</p>

<p>The veins of the kidneys, further from the heart, are
less exposed than those of the liver to the reflux that
takes place in the last moments in which the black blood
is obstructed in the lungs. Yet it however takes place,
and we see very great varieties in the quantity of blood
in the great renal vessels, a quantity independent of that
which is constantly found in the organ, and which, as I
have said, is very considerable. Now the size of the
kidney hardly corresponds to these varieties, because its
extensibility is almost nothing.</p>

<p>As to the glands situated at the two extremities, as on
the one hand the testicles, and on the other the salivary
glands, we hardly observe in them the sanguineous stagnation,
because the reflux is not sufficiently evident. We
cannot then, in this way, judge but by analogy of their
extensibility and contractility.</p>

<p>Yet the engorgements of the testicles, consequent upon
gonorrhÅ“a, and the various swellings of the parotid glands
prove that these properties exist to a certain extent. Are
the liver, the kidneys and other internal glands subject to
those acute swellings that are often seen in the sub-cuta<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>neous
ones? It is very probable; perhaps even physicians
have not paid sufficient regard to the accessory symptoms
which may arise for a moment from the pressure of these
swelled organs on the neighbouring parts. Besides, this
swelling and the contraction that follows it, may take
place especially in the cellular texture of the gland, and
consequently suppose less extensibility of the glandular
texture than they at first seem to.</p>


<h4>II. <i>Vital Properties. Properties of Animal Life.</i></h4>

<p>The animal contractility is evidently nothing in the
glandular texture. Does the sensibility of the same kind
exist in it? The following facts are connected with this.
1st. A compression of the parotid is to a certain degree
painful. I have even been obliged, in a particular case,
to give up the method of compression that Desault had
advised for a salivary fistula, on account of the pain the
patient experienced; but the numerous nerves which
traverse this gland may be the cause of these pains.
2d. We know that the instant the lithotome cuts the
prostate, or the stone and forceps pass over it, the patient
suffers very much. 3d. Stones lodged in the kidneys
occasion horrible pains. 4th. Any considerable pressure
of the testicle is very painful.</p>

<p>On the other hand we can cut the texture of the liver
and the animal will give no signs of pain. Haller, after
many experiments, ranked the glands among the insensible
parts. What is to be concluded from this? That
the animal sensibility, modified in a thousand ways, appears
to exist in many organs in which certain agents
cannot put it in action, and in which others develop it
remarkably. We know that the various morbid alterations
render it very evident in the glands. The inflammatory
pain of these organs has even a peculiar character;
it is obtuse and dull in the greatest number of cases.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
There is never experienced in them the acute sensation
which characterises cellular inflammation, or the sharp
and biting pain of which the skin is so often the seat.</p>


<h5><i>Properties of Organic Life.</i></h5>

<p>Of the properties of organic life, the sensible contractility
is wanting in the glandular system. But the two
other properties are developed in it to the highest degree.
They are in constant activity; secretion, excretion and
nutrition keep them in incessant action there. It is by
its organic sensibility that the gland distinguishes, in the
mass of blood, the materials which are proper for its
secretion. It is by its insensible contractility, or its tonic
forces, that it contracts to throw out those which are
foreign to this secretion. The first is on a small scale in
each gland, what the animal sensibility of the tongue and
the nostrils is on a large one, which allows only aliments
suitable for the stomach to be introduced into its cavity;
the other does insensibly, what is effected in so evident
a manner by the glottis, when it rises up convulsively
against a foreign body that attempts to enter it. The
blood contains the materials of all the secretions, of the
nutrition of all the organs, and of all the exhalations.
Each gland draws from this common reservoir what is
necessary to its secretion, as each organ does what is
proper for its nutrition, and as each serous surface does
what is suitable for its exhalation. Now it is by its organic
sensibility that each living part of the body distinguishes
what its functions require.</p>

<p>When the fluids enter the small vessels of the gland,
this sensibility is the sentinel that gives notice of it, and the
insensible contractility is the agent which opens or closes
the gates of the organ, according to the principles that
are presented. This comparison, if I may be allowed the
use of it, gives an idea of what then takes place. Every
glandular action turns then especially upon these two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
properties, and as this action is almost permanent, they
are then constantly in exercise.</p>

<p>From this it is evident, that all the glandular diseases
ought to suppose a derangement in these properties; for,
as we have often seen, they are the predominant properties
of an organ, those, the exercise of which constitutes its
peculiar life, which especially determine its diseases, by
their alteration. This is in fact what observation shows us.
Here we see these properties increased or diminished,
sometimes produce an increase of secretion, as in diabetes,
mercurial salivation, immoderate flow of bile, &amp;c.; sometimes
a diminution, a suspension even of this function,
as in acute diseases in which all the ducts are closed as it
were in a moment, as in the suppression of urine, dryness
of the mouth, &amp;c. It is the alteration in the nature
of the glandular sensibility that puts it in relation with
fluids foreign to the glands in a natural state; hence the
innumerable varieties of the secreted fluids especially in
diseases. I have spoken of these varieties as it regards
the mucous fluids. The liver and the kidneys particularly
do not experience less numerous ones. The taste,
the colour, the consistence and odour of cystic bile appear
in a thousand different states in dead bodies. Who
is ignorant of the innumerable alterations of which the
urine is susceptible? The saliva is less variable; but in
diseases how different is it from its natural state. It is
sufficient to have noticed for some time the various evacuations
in diseases, to see of how many modifications they
are capable. Nothing less resembles the urine and bile,
than the fluids sometimes thrown out by the bladder and
the liver; whence do these varieties arise? From this,
that the variable organic sensibility places the organ in
relation with substances to which it was foreign in a
natural state; and from this, that the insensible contractility
allows substances to enter the organ which it before
excluded. The same gland without changing its tex<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>ture,
by a modification only of its vital forces, can then
be a source of an infinite variety of different fluids; I believe
even that the kidney, by taking a sensibility analogous
to that of the liver, may secrete bile. Why may it
not secrete it, if it can secrete other fluids so different
from its own?</p>

<p>In health, each gland has a mode of sensibility nearly
uniform, a mode which changes but little; thus each
secreted fluid has an appearance, a consistence and a
nature always nearly the same. But in diseases, a thousand
causes change this mode at every instant. An hysterical
paroxysm strikes the kidneys; in an instant they
repulse all the principles that colour the urine, and this
comes out limpid; the paroxysm passes off, the organ
resumes its ordinary sensibility, and the urine returns to
its usual state. The influence of the epileptic paroxysm
extends to the sensibility of the salivary glands; in a
moment, a thick, copious and frothy saliva, wholly different
from the natural, comes from the mouth; after the
paroxysm, the sympathetic storm is calmed in the gland,
and the saliva returns to its ordinary state. If I may be
allowed the comparison, the glands are in diseases like
the atmosphere in the equinoxes. At these periods, the
winds which succeed each other and incessantly change,
often make rain, hail and snow succeed each other in a
very short time; so the forces of the glandular life, constantly
variable in diseases, make the different products
of secretion vary with rapidity.</p>

<p>It is not only to secretion that the various alterations
of the organic sensibility and the insensible contractility
of the glands extend; these alterations when long continued,
have an influence also upon their nutrition; they
disturb the course of it; hence the changes of texture,
the tumours of different kinds, the organic diseases, &amp;c.
that are so frequent in the glandular system, a system
which presents the greatest field for morbid anatomy.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
The great number of organic diseases which it exhibits,
in our dissecting rooms, compared with most of the other
systems, is very striking. The glandular, the cutaneous,
the mucous, the serous, the cellular systems, &amp;c. hold the
first rank in this respect. Observe also that it is in them
that the organic sensibility and the insensible contractility
are raised to the highest degree, because they are the
only ones in which these properties are brought into action
not only by nutrition, but also by various other functions
that are going on in the insensible capillary system, viz.
by exhalation, absorption and secretion.</p>


<h5><i>Sympathies.</i></h5>

<p>Few systems are more frequently the seat of sympathies
than this. In examining them I shall adopt the
same order as in the preceding system.</p>


<h5><i>Passive Sympathies.</i></h5>

<p>The glandular texture is affected with extreme ease by
all the others. This constitutes its passive sympathies.
They take place, 1st, in a natural state; 2d, in diseases.</p>

<p>I say first that there are certain cases in the natural state,
in which the other organs being excited, the glandular is
brought into action. This is especially remarkable in the
mucous system. We have seen that almost all the excretory
ducts terminate upon the mucous surfaces. Now
when one of these surfaces is irritated in the neighbourhood
of an excretory duct, the gland of this duct increases
its action. 1st. The presence of aliments in the
mouth produces an abundant flow of saliva. 2d. A sound
in the bladder, irritating the ureters or their neighbourhood,
increases the flow of urine. 3d. The irritation of
the glans penis and the extremity of the urethra in coition,
produces a kind of spasm in the testicle from which arises
a copious secretion of the seminal fluid. 4th. Every
irritating fluid applied either to the conjunctiva, or the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
pituitary membrane occasions a more or less considerable
flow of tears. 5th. By making experiments upon the
state of the gastric viscera during digestion and during
hunger, I have observed that as long as the aliments are
only in the stomach, the flow of bile is inconsiderable,
but that this flow increases when they pass into the duodenum,
so that much of it is then found in the intestines.
During hunger, the gall-bladder is much distended; but
little bile flows from it. At the end or even during digestion,
it contains but half as much bile. Yet it might be
emptied much more easily during abstinence, as the fluid
which is then found in it is of a deep green, very bitter,
very acrid and consequently very irritating. On the
contrary, during or immediately after digestion, it is
much milder, of a bright yellow and less irritating. There
must then be another stimulus for it during digestion;
this stimulus is the food that is passing by the extremity
of the ductus choledochus. I have pointed out in a long
note in my Treatise on the Membranes, the course of the
cystic and hepatic bile.</p>

<p>Let us conclude from these numerous considerations,
that one of the principal means which nature employs to
increase the action of the glands, and to produce that of
the excretory ducts is the sympathetic irritation of the
extremity of these ducts or of the neighbourhood of the
point of the mucous surface where they come out. It is
to this also that must be referred the various catarrhs produced
by an irritating body remaining upon one of these
surfaces. The infant in sucking and irritating the nipple,
produces a secretion of milk at the same time that he
draws it out. In a morbid state the glands are also very
frequently the seat of passive sympathies. It is almost
always then the organic sensibility and the insensible
contractility that are brought into action in them. It
is rare, that the animal sensibility, excited by sympathies,
occasions pains in the glands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span></p>

<p>We have said that the varieties the glands exhibit in
diseases are innumerable, either as it respects the quantity
or the quality of the fluids they secrete. Now all these
varieties are especially owing to sympathetic influence.
Observe the salivary glands moistening the mouth or leaving
it dry, filling it with a viscid or limpid fluid, frothy
or thin, the mucous glands of the tongue furnishing sometimes
a thick whitish substance, and sometimes a black
crust. Physicians consider the state of the tongue as a
constant index of that of the stomach; this is most often
true. Nature has established such a sympathetic relation
between these two parts, that when the mucous surface of
the stomach is disordered, and is the seat of that kind
of catarrh which is called derangement, fulness of the
stomach, &amp;c. that of the tongue is also affected and furnishes
more mucous juices, which alter and destroy the
appetite, and thus prevent the taking of aliments which
the stomach could not digest, and which often even it
would not bear. The tongue is then, as in a state of
health, a kind of sentinel placed over the stomach, to refuse
that which would injure, and to admit that which is
suitable for it. This is no doubt the cause of this singular
influence which the stomach exerts upon it in diseases.
But let us also remark that sometimes the tongue is foul,
when the stomach is in the ordinary state. This phenomenon
is frequent in hospitals; it happens to me very
often. And vice versa, nausea, &amp;c. sometimes takes place
without a catarrh of the tongue.</p>

<p>Shall I speak of the innumerable influences that the
liver, the kidney and the pancreas receive? When an
organ is diseased in the animal economy, these immediately
perceive it; their secretion is increased, diminished
or altered, and oftentimes even the sympathetic affection
does not extend to these functions, but produces inflammation,
suppuration, &amp;c. We know that abscesses are
formed in the liver from wounds in the head, &amp;c. Shall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
I speak of the innumerable varieties of the flowing of
tears in acute diseases, in inflammatory and malignant
fevers, &amp;c.? Who does not know that the eye is then
more or less moist, that it is often constantly weeping?
Now whence arise these varieties? from the sympathetic
influence which the lachrymal gland receives. The disease
itself is often foreign to it; but the unknown consensus
which connects the glands with the diseased parts,
makes them then enter into action. We weep from a
variety of passions, from grief especially; how does this
happen? Because the influence of the passion is first
carried to the epigastric region, as the violent sensation
experienced there, proves; and the affected organ reacts
upon the lachrymal gland. We weep in the same way
as we sweat from fear, or spit copiously in anger, a phenomenon
which the vulgar express by these words, <i>foaming
with rage</i>.</p>

<p>The testicles and the prostate are much less often sympathetically
influenced in diseases than the other glands.
Whilst every thing is disturbed in the glandular system,
they most frequently remain calm and tranquil. Why?
because they are insulated by their functions from the
other glands. The salivary glands, the pancreas, the kidneys,
the liver and almost all the mucous glands contribute
to one common object, viz. digestion. This object
is connected with the existence of most of the other
organs. When these are diseased, it is not wonderful
that the glands feel it. On the contrary, the testicles,
destined only to the purpose of generation, entering later
into action and ceasing to act sooner than the other glands,
having great intermissions in their action, cannot in their
affections be thus connected with the diseases of the other
organs. Sometimes however they are. We know that
some affections of the lungs dispose to venereal pleasures;
that in a natural state, a lively excitement of certain parts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
of the skin, of that of the glutÃ¦i muscles especially brings
into activity the whole genital system, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>We know the remarkable sympathy that renders the
mammÃ¦ dependant upon the womb. It is well known,
that they swell a little every month, at the beginning of
menstruation; that cancers are often formed in them at
the cessation of this natural discharge; that the voluptuous
sensation of coition sometimes extends even to them,
&amp;c. All physicians have observed this sympathetic relation
which appears to be of a peculiar kind and to depend
upon the analogy of the functions of the sympathizing
organs.</p>

<p>After severe acute diseases, especially idiopathic fevers,
the glandular action is oftentimes much increased; there
are great evacuations; these are the crises; it is, according
to the opinions of most, the morbific humour that is
expelled. This is a phenomenon that should be examined,
and which certainly in many cases does not depend,
as I shall prove, on the cause to which it has been attributed.</p>

<p>Though I consider many of the secretory derangements
in diseases as sympathetic, I am far from thinking that all
are so. Certainly in many cases, there is a general affection
of the whole system, an affection in which the glands,
like all the other parts, participate; this is what takes
place in idiopathic fevers. But when one system is especially
affected, as the cutaneous in the small pox, the
measles, scarlatina, &amp;c. the serous in pleurisy, peritonitis,
&amp;c. the cellular in phlegmon, the nervous in convulsions,
&amp;c. I call the derangement which the others experience
sympathetic, and which does not depend upon an injury
of their texture.</p>

<p>Other ideas may be attached to the word sympathies,
but these are what I have connected with it in diseases.
The word is of but little consequence, provided what it
expresses is understood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span></p>


<h5><i>Active Sympathies.</i></h5>

<p>These sympathies are less frequent than the preceding.
In the diseases of the glandular system, we see however
examples of them. The history of inflammations of the
kidneys, the salivary glands, the liver, &amp;c. shows us many
phenomena arising sympathetically in the other systems
on account of the diseases of this. I do not speak of the
derangement of digestion and the circulation, functions
which, naturally connected with the secretions, are inevitably
deranged when these are; I speak of the organs,
which having no direct relation with the diseased glands,
are yet affected, as we see in convulsions, spasms, wandering
or fixed pains in different places, sweats, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The testicles in health exert a remarkable influence
upon the organs of the voice. We know that it becomes
more harsh the moment they enter into action, and that
it changes when they are removed by castration; this
phenomenon is constant and invariable. Barthez believed
that it arose from the ordinary sympathetic phenomena;
in fact, it appears to be but a particular modification of
that general influence which the testicles exert on all the
vital forces, which are uniformly debilitated or strengthened,
according as their action is feeble or strong. Yet
some organs are more disposed than others to feel these
affections. The pectoral mucous system is an example of
this. Passive hemorrhage of this system is frequently
the consequence of excessive excretion of semen; phthisis
even is often the fatal effect of it.</p>


<h5><i>Characters of the Vital Properties. First Character.
Life peculiar to each Gland.</i></h5>

<p>The glandular life, the result of the preceding forces
considered in exercise, is not uniform in the whole system,
no doubt because its texture differs in each gland,
and because to each texture is given a peculiar modifica<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>tion
of vitality. Many phenomena result from these
differences which have been well observed by Bordeu.</p>

<p>1st. Each gland has certain substances with which it is
exclusively in relation in the natural state. Hence why
the salivary glands do not secrete bile, and the liver allows
the materials of urine to pass in its vessels without separating
them; from this results the diversity of secretions.
Hence also why cantharides affect exclusively the
kidneys; why mercury acts especially upon the salivary
glands; why certain substances affect the testicles in a
peculiar manner, increase their secretion and even promote
the excretion of the semen; why some aliments
give more milk than others. I am persuaded that certain
substances act upon the mucous glands and dispose
them to a greater secretion.</p>

<p>2d. Each gland has its peculiar mode of sympathies.
We have seen that the testicles sympathize especially with
the pectoral organs, and the liver with the brain. The
kidneys, when affected with acute pain, have an influence
peculiarly on the stomach, and occasion vomiting. The
mammÃ¦ and the womb are directly and particularly connected
in sympathies.</p>

<p>3d. The inflammation of each gland has a particular
character. That of the kidneys does not resemble that
of the liver, the testicles, &amp;c. The prostate gland when
inflamed produces symptoms wholly different from those
of the testicles, &amp;c. I do not speak of the differences
resulting from the diversity of the fluids, but only of
those which arise from the difference of texture.</p>

<p>4th. Each gland has its peculiar diseases, or such at
least to which it is disposed more than the others. Hydatids
are very often found near the convexity of the liver;
they are never seen in the salivary glands or the testicles.
Though the parotid glands are as much exposed
to the action of external bodies as the testicles, there are
twenty sarcoceles to one scirrhus of these glands. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
liver alone exhibits that peculiar state that is called fatty;
no gland is more frequently the seat of steatomatous
tumours. Physicians who have opened but few bodies,
employ the vague and insignificant word <i>obstruction</i>,
&amp;c. for every kind of glandular swelling. But observe
that most commonly these swellings have nothing in common
among them but the increase in size; their nature
is wholly different, and yet observe how ignorant many
are in medicine; they perceive by the touch that there is
a hardness of the liver, and immediately aperients, the
acetate of potash, &amp;c. are the common means which they
oppose to hydatids, to steatomatous tumours, to scirrhi
with granulations like marble, to fatty livers and to a
hundred different alterations from which the increase of
size may arise, as if it was this increase and not the
kind of tumour that produced it, which they had to combat.
Give then also aperients when the liver displaced
by hydrothorax projects unnaturally, and you will act
almost as rationally.</p>

<p>5th. Each gland exhibits peculiar modifications in those
evacuations that are called critical, of which it is sometimes
the seat after long diseases, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>6th. It is also to the difference of vitality of the different
parts of the glandular system, that must be referred
the following phenomenon; certain glands enter suddenly
into action, either from a direct irritation, or a sympathetic
excitement, as the lachrymal for example, which
from a state of remission passes suddenly from the influence
of the passions, to that of copious secretion. On
the contrary, it requires some time to excite the other
glands, as for example the kidneys, pancreas, &amp;c. which
cannot suddenly pour out their fluids, whatever may
be the excitement they experience. The same stimulus
applied to the conjunctiva, produces a flow of tears, and
at the same time increases the action of the Meibomian
glands; but the first effect takes place before the other.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
The same stimuli applied to the mucous surfaces can
never produce a catarrhal discharge till the expiration of
some time.</p>


<h5><i>Second Character. Remission of the Glandular Life.</i></h5>

<p>The second character of the glandular life, is that of
being subject to habitual alternations of increase and diminution.
Sleep extends especially to the animal functions;
they alone are completely suspended in the ordinary state,
and it is this which constitutes sleep. But the glands
sleep also to a certain extent, though there is never a
complete suspension except in diseases. I would compare
the sleep of animal life to the intermissions of intermittent
fevers in which the apyrexia is complete, and the
sleep of the glands to those of remitting fevers in which
the paroxysm is only moderated, though it always continues.</p>

<p>The saliva is copiously poured out when aliments enter
the mouth, at other times it only moistens this cavity.
Whilst the chyme is passing through the duodenum, the
pancreas and liver moisten it abundantly; they are also
in action during hunger, but in an infinitely less degree.
I have convinced myself of this by many experiments
upon the comparative state of digestion and hunger; the
substance of these experiments I have given elsewhere.
We know that it is some time after eating before the
kidneys commence their action. The intermissions of
the action of the mammÃ¦ are almost as real as those of
the organs of animal life. Each mucous gland has its
time of secretion; it is that in which the surfaces, to
which the excretories go, are in contact with any substance
that is remaining there, or that is only passing.</p>

<p>The glands then must be considered as continually separating
a fluid from the blood, and as being at certain
periods in greater activity, and consequently as furnishing
more fluids.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span></p>

<p>This remission of the glands appears to be owing to a
cause nearly analogous to that of sleep, which, in animal
life, is produced by the weariness the sensitive and locomotive
organs experience, after long continued action.
The kind of weariness which the glands are capable of
experiencing, is not in general attended with a painful
sensation, as in animal life; its nature appears to be
wholly different. Yet women, after nursing too long, feel
a pain in the breast that warns them to leave off. The
testicles become the seat of a painful sensation, when the
emission of semen has been many times forced.</p>


<h5><i>Third Character. The Glandular Life is never simultaneously
raised in the whole system.</i></h5>

<p>The vital properties of the glands are never simultaneously
excited in all. When one is in action, the others
are in remission. We might say, that there is but a determinate
quantity of life for all, and that one cannot live
more without the others living less. To this law is the
digestive order accommodated. In the first period the
salivary glands furnish at first a great quantity of fluid;
in the second, the parietes of the stomach; in the third,
in which the chyme passes into the small intestines,
the liver and the pancreas are principally in action; in
the fourth, it is the mucous glands of the great intestines
which especially act; and finally the kidneys enter into a
particular action in order to evacuate the residue of the
fluids. All the glands cannot act at the same time; it is
as in the external motions in which certain muscles always
rest whilst the others contract. The most improper time
for coition is that of digestion, because we then make
the mucous, hepatic, pancreatic secretions, &amp;c. coincide
with that of the testicles. In diseases one gland increases
its secretion only at the expense of the others. Observation
proves this every day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span></p>

<p>We might, as I have said, make use of this remark,
by producing in various glandular and other affections,
artificial catarrhs, a disease which we can always produce
on the mucous surfaces by the introduction of a foreign
body. I have for some time past made much use of
ammonia respired by the nose. Pinel prescribes it before
the paroxysms of epilepsy. There are an infinite
number of other cases in which it is very efficacious, as
in some kinds of cephalalgia, in ataxic fevers, in certain
apoplexies, in various comatose affections, &amp;c. A blister
does not act till the expiration of some time; it requires
four, five, six hours even for it to produce an irritation.
Who does not know that oftentimes in diseases in which
the forces are much prostrated, it has no action on the
cutaneous system? On the contrary, the excitement of
the pituitary membrane by ammonia is always sudden on
the one hand and always efficacious on the other. Its
effect, it is true, is only instantaneous, but this is precisely
its advantage; for in many cases a blister is only
useful the moment it irritates the skin; hence the use of
drying it immediately and reapplying it. The employment
of ammonia or of any other strong stimulant upon
the pituitary membrane, can be repeated every quarter of
an hour, every five or six minutes or even every minute.
If habit renders the patient less sensible to its excitement,
we can replace it by another irritating substance,
whereas we cannot thus change the cutaneous excitement
by a blister. What I have said of the pituitary surface is
applicable to those of the rectum, the urethra and stomach,
on which we can in many cases apply in diseases excitements
in a more advantageous manner than is done upon
the skin by means of blisters.</p>

<p>Moreover, the character of the glandular life of which
we are treating, is only an insulated modification of a
character general to all the vital properties, a character
which consists in this, that they are weakened in one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
place when they are raised in another. Hence why the
great collections of pus, large tumours and dropsies are
always attended with a weakness in the glandular action.
It is upon this character that rests the use of vesicatories,
setons, moxa, cauteries, &amp;c. which do not act, as has been
said, by evacuating the morbific matter, but by making
the irritation of the diseased part cease by that which is
produced elsewhere.</p>


<h5><i>Fourth Character. Influence of climate and season
on Glandular Life.</i></h5>

<p>Another phenomenon is also derived from the preceding
character, and it is one that may be likewise considered
as characteristic of the glandular system; viz.
that in general it is in greater activity in winter than
summer, in cold climates than in warm. In fact, heat
which expands the cutaneous system increases the action
of it at the expense of that of the glands, and reciprocally
cold which contracts it, by preventing the constant
exhalation that is going on there, forces the glandular
system to supply this action. Hence why the same fluid,
introduced into the economy, goes out with the urine in
winter and with the sweat in summer; why, if we wish
to produce an immediate discharge of urine in summer,
it is necessary to suppress the perspiration by the sudden
application of cold to the surface of the skin, by descending
into a cellar, or some other subterraneous place; so
that in summer we can, after digestion, make the product
of the fluids pass off with the urine or the sweat, according
to the temperature of the atmosphere in which we
digest; why teas and diuretics forbid the use of each
other, and why a physician who should employ them at
the same time would know but little of the laws of our
economy; why most of the diseases that are attended
with an immoderate discharge of the secreted fluids, are
almost always characterized by a diminution of the ex<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>haled
fluids; why in some seasons diseases have a greater
tendency to be characterized by sweats, and in others by
urinary, mucous evacuations, &amp;c. It is to the greater
degree of the vital activity of the glandular system in
the winter, that must then be referred the frequency of
catarrhs, diseases most of which suppose an unnatural increase
of its action, the greater facility with which the
kidneys are influenced by cantharides, &amp;c. Physicians
should have these considerations particularly in view in
their treatment. It is necessary to act more upon the
glandular system in winter, and the cutaneous in summer,
because each system is as much more disposed to
answer to the excitements made upon it, as it actually is
in greater activity.</p>


<h5><i>Fifth Character. Influence of Sex upon Glandular
Life.</i></h5>

<p>Is the life of the glandular system more active in man
than in woman? As it respects the glands destined to
digestion, the secretion of the tears, the evacuation of
urine, &amp;c. there is but little difference in the two sexes.
As to genital glands, man has testicles and the prostate;
woman has mammÃ¦, so that in this respect they seem to
be equal. Observe however that the influence of the
first upon the economy, is much greater than that of the
second. It is from the womb that go forth in woman
the irradiations which correspond with those which the
testicles send to all the other organs.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>ARTICLE FOURTH.<br />

<small>DEVELOPMENT OF THE GLANDULAR SYSTEM.</small></h3>


<h4>I. <i>State of this System in the FÅ“tus.</i></h4>

<p>Though the secretions are not active in the fÅ“tus, the
glandular system is in general much developed. All the
salivary glands and the pancreas are larger in proportion
than afterwards; the liver is enormous; and the
kidneys have a size much greater in proportion than they
have in the adult. The same probably is true of the
mucous glands, though I have not made any very precise
researches upon this point. The form is different in
many; the kidney for example is evidently uneven,
whilst afterwards its surface is almost smooth. The colour
is not the same; this is particularly striking in the salivary
and lachrymal glands. These glands which are white
in the adult, have in the fÅ“tus an extreme redness which
they lose by washing, which is not owing to the blood
circulating in their vessels, though there is much of it in
their vessels, but it is really inherent in their texture.
This colour is never as great in the pancreas, though its
texture is nearly the same. The texture of the glands
is extremely soft and delicate at this age, which is the
case with all the parts. They are divided and yield with
great ease, and their vessels, which are large, carry into
them a very great quantity of fluid.</p>

<p>Then they are, if we may so say, in a state corresponding
with that of remission in the adult; they secrete even
less fluid, though they appear however to be in constant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
action. In fact, all the reservoirs would be insufficient
to contain their fluids, if in a given time, as much flowed
from them as after birth. Is this because the black blood,
which then enters their parenchyma, is unfit to furnish
the materials of the secretions? This may have an influence,
and I have elsewhere imagined it, from the circumstance
that this blood is unable to support many other
functions. But the principal reason appears to me to be,
that in the fÅ“tus the nutritive motion of composition predominates
evidently over that of decomposition, which
is very inconsiderable. Almost every thing which arrives
in the organs remains in them and continues to furnish the
materials of the rapid growth which is then taking place in
the body; now, the secretions being principally destined
to carry off the residue of nutrition, must then be very
inactive.</p>

<p>Besides, digestion does not introduce into the blood any
of those principles which, being useless to nutrition,
must on this account go out as they entered, that is to say
without making a part of our organs; such are for example
most of the drinks, which only pass into the mass of
blood, and go out immediately with the urine.</p>

<p>The glands of the fÅ“tus are then like the brain at that
age; though much developed, they remain inactive; they
are in the expectation of action.</p>


<h4>II. <i>State of the Glandular System during Growth.</i></h4>

<p>At birth, the glandular system increases suddenly in
energy; it takes a life which until then was foreign to
it, and begins to pour out more fluid. It owes this change,
1st, to the difference of the blood which enters it, and
which till then black and consequently venous, then becomes
red and charged with principles that are new to
it; 2d, to the general and sudden excitement carried to
the extremity of all the excretories, by the aliments to
those which open upon the canal that extends from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
mouth to the anus, by the air to the mucous ducts of the
bronchial and pituitary surfaces and to the lachrymal
gland, by the various frictions of the extremity of the
glans penis and even by the air which acts also upon it,
to the kidneys and the bladder.</p>

<p>All the glands are so much the more sensible to this
sudden excitement, as they are unaccustomed to it. Their
sensibility, heretofore torpid, is roused; they feel the
contact of the blood which enters them and which till
then had made only a feeble impression upon them.
This sensation is so much the more acute, as on the one
hand the organic sensibility of the glands becomes more
evident, and as on the other the red blood is a more
powerful stimulus than the black; for, as I have already
had occasion to observe, the blood that arrives in an organ
produces two effects in it, one of which is to excite
it, either by the motion it communicates, or by the contact
of the principles it contains, and the other is to
furnish materials for the different functions, as for exhalation,
secretion, nutrition, &amp;c. The first effect is common
to all the organs which the blood enters; the second
is peculiar to each.</p>

<p>I would observe however that many of the secretions
are much less active during the first years, than they are
afterwards; such are those of the salivary glands, the
liver, &amp;c. The kidneys being destined to throw out the
residue of digestion, as much and more often than that of
nutrition, are in a state of activity in proportion to that
of the first function. The infant often passes urine, as
he frequently voids excrements. It is not because many
substances, returning from the organs which they have
nourished, present themselves to the kidneys, to be
thrown out by this part.</p>

<p>The affections of the glandular system are not the predominant
ones in early age. 1st. It is not the parotids
that are enlarged in the frequent swellings that take place<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
in their neighbourhood, but it is almost always the lymphatic
glands. 2d. We know that an excessive flow of
bile, and the affections which arise from it, are then very
rare. 3d. All the secretions relating to generation are
absolutely nothing. 4th. In the same proportion in which
the organic affections of the liver and the kidneys are
common in the adult, are they rare in the infant. Then
it is in what are improperly called lymphatic glands, in
the brain, &amp;c. that the morbid anatomist finds materials
for his researches; for observe that the organs which are
particularly in action in one age, are those which are most
often attacked by acute and chronic diseases at that age,
and that on the contrary they seem to forget those in
which but little is done. 5th. Surgeons know that sarcoceles,
hydroceles by effusion, varicoceles and all the
diseases of the testicles are as rare before the period of
puberty, when nutrition only is going on in these glands,
as they are common in the subsequent years.</p>

<p>It appears that it is the mucous glands which are then
the most commonly affected and are consequently in the
greatest activity. The lachrymal glands are also very
frequently in action. The infant weeps more often than
the adult; we might say that all the passions which agitate
this age have but one uniform mode of expression,
and this mode is weeping. If the infant suffers, if he is
jealous or frightened he weeps; if he is furious, he weeps
because he is not very strong. This influence of the passions
upon the lachrymal gland in the early years, seems
to take place at the expense of the influence exerted upon
the other glands. It is rare that fear or fright give to
infants a sudden jaundice, or that they excite bilious
secretions. At this age they do not pass water and void
their excrements from fright as often as in the after ages;
they have not the spasmodic vomitings that are so frequently
occasioned by the passions of the adult; they do
not become pale or red as much in anger; thus the coun<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>tenance
is not to the same extent the moveable picture
upon which is painted the emotions of the mind. The
eye does not sparkle in anger and is not expressive in
friendship. It is the lachrymal gland which then most
often serves in the face, for the expression of the passions.
Observe that this expression is that of weakness and want
of power, it is that of woman, who resembles the infant
in so many phenomena. The feeble stag opposes his tears
to the dogs, who seize upon him to devour him.</p>

<p>The glandular texture remains for a long time soft and
delicate in the infant. At birth and in the fÅ“tus, neither
the liver nor the kidneys have the singular property of
hardening by boiling. They remain during this experiment
very tender and yield easily to the least impression.
If the boiling be ever so long continued, they do not lose
this character, which is gradually weakened as we advance
in age, and which at this period makes the glands
fit for some uses in our kitchens to which they are not so
proper in the adult.</p>


<h4>III. <i>State of the Glandular System after Growth.</i></h4>

<p>Puberty commences about the period that growth finishes.
A gland till then inactive in man, enters suddenly
into activity. The prostate follows it in its development.
In woman the breasts swell, separate, and acquire in a
short time a size which they would not have done in
many years, if they had grown according to the same
laws as in the preceding state. The other glands, far from
being weakened, in proportion as these become stronger,
increase their action also; they become stronger, and
gradually lose the softness that characterized them in infancy;
they moreover grow harder.</p>

<p>Till then composition had predominated over decomposition
in the general nutritive motion. Then almost as
many substances are constantly thrown from each organ,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
as enter its interior to nourish it. Now as the glands
are the great emunctories which throw out the residue of
nutrition, they then pour out more fluids in proportion
than before.</p>

<p>During youth it is the genital glands which predominate
over the others; they seem to be a centre whence
go irradiations that animate the whole machine. We
might say most often that they are, in the mechanism of
our moral actions, the spring which puts every thing in
motion.</p>

<p>As we recede from youth, the influence of the genital
glands becomes weaker, because they are in less activity.
Towards the thirty-sixth or fortieth year, it is especially
the glands destined to digestion which predominate over
the others, and among these the liver in particular seems
to be in activity. Then the bilious affections are predominant;
then the passions to which the bilious temperament
seems to dispose us, more frequently agitate the
mind. Ambition, hatred and jealousy are often the sad
attendants of this age. These passions are then more
durable. The levity of youth and the passions arising
from the influence of the genital glands, which predominate
at this age, had for a time suppressed these, or rather
had prevented them from being developed. Then they
remain alone, the others having escaped in smoke with
the fire of youth. Then also the influence of the lively
emotions of the mind affects especially the glands and the
abdominal viscera. Then is felt that contraction at the
epigastric region, the painful effect of the bad passions;
jaundice occasioned by sorrow is then more frequent.</p>

<p>This age is that of the organic affections of the glands,
of all the numerous changes of texture, of all the excrescences
which destroying as it were the nature of these
organs, transform them into bodies of a different texture.
In infancy, leucophlegmasia is most often produced by an
engorgement of those lymphatic bunches that are called<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
glands, which resembles tabes mesenterica, the engorgement
of the bronchial glands, &amp;c. In the adult on the
contrary, it is with the diseases of the liver, of the spleen,
of the kidneys, that it is most often seen.</p>


<h4>IV. <i>State of the Glandular System in Old Age.</i></h4>

<p>In old age, the glands become more firm and hard.
Before that period even, the glandular system of animals
ceases to be used at our tables. The liver, the kidneys, the
spleen, &amp;c. are mixed with the fleshy texture in common
boiled meat, only to communicate to it some salts, some
savoury principles that are foreign to this texture. They
are not eaten, or at least they are not agreeable to the
taste. The lungs which contain so great a quantity of
mucous glands, do not afford a very digestible aliment except
those of the calf; those of the ox are not brought
to our tables, especially when the animal is old. I would
observe upon this subject that the muscular and glandular
systems are in an inverse order as it respects digestion,
at least in the stewed state to which they are reduced for
nourishment. In fact, the glandular system has not an
agreeable taste and is not very digestible except in young
animals, whilst at this age the muscular is insipid, and
does not become savoury food till towards the middle of
life.</p>

<p>In extreme old age, the colour of the glands changes
less than that of most of the other organs. We find the
liver, the kidneys, &amp;c. almost as full of blood as in the
adult; they are as red, whilst the muscles pale and colourless
announce by their appearance that but little blood
enters them at the latter periods of life. We might say
that this fluid first abandons the skin and the muscles of
animal life which in the trunk are subjacent to it, and
which in the extremities are found very distant from the
heart, or at least that it diminishes much in the two sys<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>tems,
and is concentrated in the organs in the neighbourhood
of the heart; thus the secretions are still very
abundant in old people, whilst the muscular, nervous
forces, &amp;c. are considerably weakened. The kidneys
still secrete much urine; the liver pours out much bile,
though this gland loses in part the kind of predominance
it exercised in the economy towards the fortieth year.
We know that the very frequent catarrhs that then take
place, indicate an increase of action in the mucous glands.
The functions of the testicles and mammÃ¦ have long
since ceased.</p>

<p>The activity of the glands remaining in exercise, appears
to be owing to two causes. 1st. The decomposition being
very great at this age, many substances are presented to
the glands to be thrown out. An old person decreases
by a phenomenon opposite to the rapid growth of the
fÅ“tus, in which the glandular system throws out scarcely
any thing from the economy. 2d. The skin having the
horny hardness and being contracted, ceasing in part to
be an emunctory of the products of decomposition, the
glands supply the place of these functions. The cutaneous
and glandular systems are then in the same relation
as in winter and in cold countries, in which, we have
seen, that the second constantly supplies the place of the
first.</p>

<p>In general, the glandular system is one of those in
which life is the most slowly extinguished. In the dead
bodies of old people we find the bile still filling the gall-bladder,
the bladder full of urine, &amp;c. All the glands
when compressed, the prostate itself, permit a large
quantity of fluid to escape from their excretories. I have
even observed that in this compression, we uniformly
press out more fluid in an old subject than in a young
one. The older the animals are, the more their kidneys,
as we know, preserve the urinous smell. The lungs,
which abound so much in mucous surfaces and conse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>quently
in mucous glands, are not withered and have not
the horny hardening in old age; they perform their functions
as regularly as in youth.</p>

<p>In general it is a very remarkable phenomenon that all
the principal internal organs, the liver, the kidneys, the
spleen, the heart, the lungs, &amp;c. still preserve a very considerable
vital force, whilst the sensitive and locomotive
organs already almost exhausted, have broken in part
the communications which connect the individual with
the objects which surround him.</p>

<h2 id="DERMOID_SYSTEM">DERMOID SYSTEM.</h2>


<p>All animals are covered with a more or less compact
membrane, of a thickness in general proportioned to the
size of their body, destined to defend the subjacent parts,
to carry out a considerable portion of the residue of nutrition
and digestion, and to place it in relation with external
bodies. It is in man a sensitive boundary, placed
at the extremity of the domain of his mind, where these
bodies continually touch, for the purpose of establishing
the relations of his animal life, and of thus connecting
his existence with that of every thing which surrounds
him. This covering is the <i>dermis</i> or skin. We shall
call the whole of it the Dermoid System.</p>


<hr class="chap" />

<h3>ARTICLE FIRST.<br />

<small>FORMS OF THE DERMOID SYSTEM.</small></h3>

<p>The covering which forms this system, being proportioned
to the parts that it covers, is applied to these parts,
adapted to their great inequalities, and allows the largest
external prominences to be visible, but conceals a great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
number on account of their small size; thus the appearance
of the body stripped of skin differs very much from
that with the skin on.</p>

<p>This covering everywhere continuous is reflected
through different openings in the interior of the body
and goes to give origin to the mucous system. The
limits between the two systems are always marked by a
reddish line; within this line is the mucous system,
without it the dermoid. Yet the demarcation is not as
striking in the organization as in the colour. Both are
confounded in an insensible manner. In the neighbourhood
of these openings, of those of the face especially,
the dermoid becomes more delicate. At the commencement
of these openings, the mucous borrows more or
less, as I have said, the characters of the first.</p>


<h4>I. <i>External Surface of the Dermoid System.</i></h4>

<p>This surface, everywhere contiguous to the epidermis,
is remarkable for the hairs which cover it, for the oily
fluid which constantly lubricates it, for the sweat that is
deposited on it, for the sense of feeling of which it is the
seat and which the internal surface does not possess. We
shall in this article consider only the external dermoid
forms, without regard to these different objects.</p>

<p>We see upon this surface different kinds of folds.</p>

<p>1st. Some are owing to the subjacent muscles which,
being intimately connected with the dermis, forming
almost a part of it, wrinkle it when they contract. Such
are the wrinkles on the forehead; those in the form of
rays which the orbicularis produces around the eye-lids,
&amp;c.; those of which the cheeks are the seat, when the
great and small zygomatic, &amp;c. contract; those which the
orbicularis of the lips produces around the mouth, when
it contracts it by diminishing its opening, &amp;c. All these
folds are owing to this, that on the one hand the skin
cannot contract like the muscles, and that on the other it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
is necessary that it should occupy less space in length at
the instant these are shortened. They are of the same
nature as those of which the mucous surfaces, that of the
stomach in particular, become the seat in the contraction
of the fleshy layer which is contiguous to them. Thus
the direction of these folds is always perpendicular to
that of the subjacent muscles whose fibres they cut at a
right angle. We are accustomed to attach much importance
to the existence of these wrinkles in the expression
of the passions; no doubt because then they are strongly
marked. In fact the breadth of the face of man makes
it well adapted to their development, whilst that of animals
is badly formed to produce them. Thus their eye,
rather than the features of the face, is the moveable picture
which is differently sketched at every instant by the
various feelings of anger, hatred, jealousy, &amp;c. The
wrinkles of the human face contribute very much to the
expression of the countenance, they compose in part the
physiognomy, and mark its different shades.</p>

<p>The wrinkles of the scrotum are analogous to these;
they depend upon the contraction of the subjacent cellular
texture, in which some fleshy fibres appear also to exist.</p>

<p>2d. There are other wrinkles which are owing also to
the motions, but not to those of the subjacent muscles.
There are those of the sole of the foot, and especially
those of the palm of the hand. There is not there any
sub-cutaneous muscle adhering to the skin, except the
small palmar muscle, which has no agency in these wrinkles
that are formed at the places where the skin is constantly
folded in flexion. Thus there are many of them
about all the articulations of the phalanges. In the palm
of the hand, we see three principal ones, one at the base
of the thumb, produced by the motion of opposition,
another at the anterior part of the palm, occasioned by
the flexion of the four last phalanges which are bent towards
the thumb, and the third is found in the middle of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
the palm. The dermis is folded between these depressed
lines, in the motions in which the hand is hollowed.
Many other small folds corresponding with less evident
and less frequent motions, cut these at different angles.</p>

<p>On the back of the foot and hand, there are many
wrinkles about each articulation of the phalanges, when
they are extended. They disappear in flexion, and are
owing to this, that nature, on account of the motions, has
made the skin more loose at this place, and broader in
proportion to the parts it covers. About most of the
articulations, there are analogous folds, but they are
much less evident, because the skin adheres less to the
neighbouring parts. Upon the whole trunk, the arm, the
fore-arm, the thigh and the leg, we see no depressions but
those from the muscular prominences.</p>

<p>3d. There is a third species of wrinkles, or rather cutaneous
impressions, which are not very evident, found
especially on the sole of the foot and the palm of the
hand and which we easily distinguish from the preceding;
they are those which indicate the rows of the papillÃ¦.
The surface of the trunk presents hardly any thing similar.</p>

<p>4th. Finally, there are the wrinkles of old age, which
are of a wholly different nature. The sub-cutaneous fat
having in part disappeared, the skin becomes too large
for the parts it covers; now as it has lost with age its
contractility of texture, it does not contract, but folds in
various directions. Thus where there was the most fat,
as on the face, these wrinkles are the most evident, they
resemble those that appear on the abdomen after several
pregnancies, dropsy, &amp;c. In young people, if emaciation
takes place suddenly, the skin contracts, and no wrinkle
is formed.</p>


<h4>II. <i>Internal Surface of the Dermoid System.</i></h4>

<p>This surface answers everywhere to the cellular texture
which is loose upon the trunk, the thighs, the arms,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
&amp;c. and which is condensed upon the cranium, the hand,
&amp;c. In most animals, a fleshy layer called panniculus,
and of a form analogous to that which is almost everywhere
subjacent to the mucous system of man, separates
the skin from the other parts, and communicates to it
various motions. In man, the dermoid system exhibits
here and there traces of this internal muscle, as is observed
in the platysma myoides, the occipito-frontalis and
most of the muscles of the face. There is nothing similar
on the trunk, extremities, &amp;c. Man is as much inferior
in this respect to most animals, as he is superior by
the arrangement of his facial muscles. Thus observe that
whilst in him all the passions are painted as it were upon
the face, and the whole exterior of the trunk remains
calm in these tempests of the mind, this exterior is convulsively
agitated in animals. The mane of the lion becomes
erect, the whole skin of the horse moves, a thousand
different agitations animate the exterior of the trunk
of animals, and make it a general picture on which is
painted all that passes in the interior. You can determine
from behind, in many animals, by seeing only their
bodies, that they are agitated with passion; cover the face
of man, the curtain is drawn over the mirror of his mind;
thus almost all nations leave it uncovered. The physiognomy
is in this respect, if we may so say, more generally
spread over the exterior, in animals with a fleshy
panniculus.</p>

<p>Besides the cellular texture, the dermis is almost everywhere
subjacent to the muscles in the trunk; but, foreign
to the motions of these muscles, it receives no sensible
influence from them. In the extremities it is found
separated from the fleshy layers by aponeurotic expansions.
Many vessels wind under it; the great veins pass
through its texture; many arterial ramifications go upon
its surface, and many nerves between these ramifications.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>ARTICLE SECOND.<br />

<small>ORGANIZATION OF THE DERMOID SYSTEM.</small></h3>


<h4>I. <i>Texture peculiar to this Organization.</i></h4>

<p>This texture comprehends, 1st, the chorion; 2d, that
which is called the reticular body; 3d, the papillÃ¦. The
chorion is the essential part of the dermis; it is that
which determines its thickness and form. The reticular
body appears to be but little distinct from it. The papillÃ¦
arise from it also, but are more evident.</p>


<h5><i>Chorion.</i></h5>

<p>The chorion is of a very variable thickness. 1st. In
the head, that of the cranium and that of the face exhibit
an opposite arrangement. The first is very thick and
also dense and compact, which is owing especially to the
numerous hairs that go through it. The second, everywhere
fine and delicate, is particularly so upon the eyelids
and the lips. 2d. The chorion of the trunk is posteriorly
and all along the back, of a thickness almost double
that of its anterior part, where it is nearly the same upon
the neck, the chest and the abdomen. I would except
however that of the penis, the scrotum, the great labia
and the mammÃ¦, in which its delicacy is greater than any
where else. 3d. In the superior extremities it is nearly
uniform upon the shoulders, the arm and the fore-arm;
on the hand it increases a little in thickness and more in
the palm than on the back. 4th. This thickness is generally
much more evident on the thigh and the leg, where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
there are more muscles, than on the arm or the fore-arm.
On the foot, it increases as on the hand, less in the dorsal
than in the plantar region, which is the thickest of all the
parts of the dermoid system; which is owing principally
in the natural state to the arrangement of its epidermis.
We see from this, that though everywhere continuous,
the chorion is very different in its different parts. The
relation of its thickness with its functions is easily perceived
on the hand, the foot, the cranium, &amp;c. Elsewhere
we cannot so well see the reason of these differences,
which are notwithstanding as constant.</p>

<p>Woman has a chorion generally less thick than that of
man; compared in all the regions, it exhibits in the two
sexes a sensible difference; on the mammÃ¦ especially, it
is much more delicate in woman. That of the great
labia however is proportionally thicker than that of the
scrotum.</p>

<p>In order to understand perfectly the intimate structure
of the chorion, it is necessary to examine it at first on its
internal surface, after having carefully separated it from
the fatty cellular texture, to which this surface adheres
more or less intimately. We see then that it is differently
arranged according to the regions.</p>

<p>1st. On the sole of the foot and the palm of the hand,
we observe an infinite number of white fibres, shining
like aponeurotic fibres, which are detached from this internal
surface, form upon it a kind of new layer, cross
each other in all directions, leave between them, especially
towards the heel many spaces of different sizes, that
are filled with fat, separate more and more, and are finally
lost in the sub-cutaneous texture, nearly as the fibres of
the brachial aponeurosis insensibly disappear in the neighbouring
cellular texture. Hence why when we dissect
the palmar and plantar integuments, we experience the
greatest difficulty in separating them entirely from the
cellular texture which is interlaced with these fibres;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
hence why also these surfaces have not, on the parts
which they cover, the mobility which many others
exhibit.</p>

<p>The density of the cellular texture contributes also
something to this arrangement which is essential to the
functions of the foot and the hand, which are designed to
seize and grasp external bodies.</p>

<p>2d. The dermis of the superior and inferior extremities
of the back, of the neck, of the thorax, of the abdomen,
of the face even and consequently of almost all the
body, is distinguished from the preceding, because the
fibres are much less distinct, and are not lost in the cellular
texture by being as it were confounded with it, whence
arises a remarkable laxity of the skin of these parts, and
the very great facility with which it is dissected; in a
word because the spaces between these fibres are much
more narrow. These spaces appear like an infinite number
of holes irregularly placed at the side of each other,
containing most of them small fatty parcels of the neighbouring
texture, and exhibiting, when these small parcels
have been carefully removed, very evident vacuities. The
fibres which form them, are sufficiently near each other,
to make you believe at first view, that it is a surface
pierced with an infinite number of holes, that has been
applied under the skin. On the contrary, on the hand
and the foot, towards the heel especially, it is a true net-work
the spaces of which are larger than the fibres that
form them; this is the reverse here. Be that as it may,
these spaces in the internal surface of the chorion are
very favourable to the action of tannin which penetrates
the texture infinitely better from this side than from the
opposite, because it insinuates itself into these numerous
openings. I have had occasion to observe it in the human
chorion which I have had tanned for the purpose. Chaptal
has observed that the epidermis is a real obstacle to
the action of tannin, and that on this account scraping is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
a preliminary operation essential to tanning, since it allows
the skin to be penetrated on both sides; but even when
thus scraped, it receives the tannin much more easily on
the side of the flesh than on the opposite one.</p>

<p>3d. The chorion of the back of the hand and the foot,
as well as that of the forehead does not exhibit these
numerous openings on its internal surface; it is smooth
and white, especially when it has been macerated a little.
It is precisely the same as that of the scrotum, the prepuce
and even the great labia. The texture of it is more
compact, no space is left in it, so that though more delicate
than that of the extremities and the trunk, it contains
almost as much substance. As to the chorion corresponding
to the hair and the beard, we see in it only the
openings necessary for the passage of the hairs, and which
are wholly different from those of which I spoke just
now, which form real culs-de-sac, and do not pierce
through the chorion.</p>

<p>Hence the internal face of the dermoid chorion exhibits
three very distinct modifications. The first and last are
seen to a small extent, whilst the second is almost general,
with some differences however in the trunk, the extremities
and the head. Besides, these modifications do
not suppose a diversity of nature, but only of forms.
Much separated and arranged in fibres in the first, the
dermoid texture is compact and condensed a little in the
second, and by this condensation renders the spaces less
distinct. But there is a means of seeing them everywhere
very well, where there is the least trace of them,
and this is by maceration. This means also shows the
dermoid texture best. In fact, when the skin has remained
for some time in water, it softens, the fibres of
its chorion separate, and their interstices become more
distinct; then we see that the spaces exist not only on
the internal surface, but that they extend into its texture
which appears to be truly like a sieve in its whole thick<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>ness,
so numerous are the spaces arising from the interlacing
of the fibres.</p>

<p>These spaces do not terminate in culs-de-sac towards
the external surface; they open upon this surface by many
foramina which are very evident in a skin that has been
macerated for a month or two, and which, in the ordinary
state are almost imperceptible in some subjects, and very
visible in others. Besides, in order to see them it is
necessary to remove the epidermis; now as with the
view of producing this effect immediately we commonly
employ the action of boiling water or fire, the dermoid
texture by this means acquires the horny hardening, and
they become much less apparent, whereas maceration not
only does not produce horny hardening of the skin, but
it expands and dilates it, which renders these foramina
very evident. In some parts of the skin and in certain
subjects, we might then introduce the head of a pin into
them; in others they are less evident. These foramina
never pierce the dermis perpendicularly, all open obliquely
to its surface; so that a perpendicular pressure
tends to close them and bring their parietes in contact.
I cannot compare their termination better than to that of
the ureters in the bladder; hence why the hairs which
go through them are never perpendicular, but oblique to
the skin. We speak incorrectly when we say that the
hairs are planted obliquely; their insertion in the bulb is
perpendicular; it is in their passage through the chorion
that they change direction.</p>

<p>Besides, these foramina are not vessels, but mere communications
from the interior to the exterior through
which pass the hairs, the exhalants, the absorbents, the
blood-vessels and the nerves which go to the surface of
the dermis; thus the subjacent spaces are only cells in
which are contained the vessels of the glands and of the
cellular texture. The dermoid texture should then be
considered as a real net-work, as a kind of cellular tex<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>ture,
the cells of which very evident within, become less
so on the exterior surface, with which all communicate
to transmit to it different organs. The chorion is then
the outline, the frame, if I may so say, of the cutaneous
organ. It serves to lodge in its spaces, all the other
parts which enter into the structure of this organ, and
contributes to give them the form they are to have, but
is wholly foreign to them.</p>

<p>What is the nature of this texture, which enters especially
into the composition of the cutaneous chorion?
I know not; but I think it has much analogy with the
texture of the fibrous system; the following considerations
support this analogy. 1st. On the heel, where the
dermoid texture has the fibrous form of the irregular ligaments,
it would be almost impossible to distinguish it from
it, so uniform is the external appearance; it has the same
resistance and density; the same sensation is experienced
when it is cut with the bistoury. 2d. The dermoid texture
becomes yellow and transparent like the fibrous by
stewing. 3d. It melts gradually like it into gelatine.
4th. Like it, except the tendons however, it strongly
resists maceration. 5th. Sometimes these two textures
are identified; for example, the annular ligaments of the
wrist evidently send elongations to the neighbouring dermoid
texture. 6th. This texture can serve, like the
fibrous, for the insertion of muscles; we see it in the face,
where many of the fibres of the orbicularis of the lips
and the eyelids, and almost all those of the eyebrows,
find real tendons in the fibres of the dermoid texture.
There is the same arrangement in the cutaneous palmar
muscles.</p>

<p>All these considerations evidently establish many relations
between the dermoid and fibrous textures. Yet they
are far from being the same. To be convinced of this it
is sufficient to observe how much their mode of sensibility
differs, and how different also are their diseases; it seems<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
at first as if there was no analogy between them in this
double relation. Yet the line of demarcation is by no
means as great as it appears to be. In fact the acute sensibility
of the skin is not seated precisely in this white
texture, which is interwoven so as to leave between its
meshes the spaces of which we have spoken, and which
we see especially on the surface adhering to this organ.
The experiment mentioned in the article on the mucous
system, and in which I irritated the cutaneous organ from
within outwards, evidently proves it. It is the surface
on which the papillÃ¦ are found that especially exhibits
this vital property.</p>

<p>On the other hand morbid anatomy proves that the internal
surface of the dermis, in which are especially found
the texture and the spaces of which we have spoken, is
entirely free from most cutaneous eruptions. This is no
doubt true as it respects the small pox, the itch and many
species of herpes; I have satisfied myself of it as to the
vaccine vesicles, the miliary eruption, &amp;c. &amp;c. It is
certain that in erysipelas, the external surface only of the
chorion is coloured by the blood which enters the exhalants;
thus the slightest pressure, causing the blood to
flow back, produces a sudden whiteness which soon disappears
by the return of the blood into the exhalants. It
is this which forms the essential difference between simple
erysipelas and phlegmon, in which not only the external
face of the chorion, but its whole texture and the subjacent
cellular one are inflamed. In measles and scarlatina,
the redness is also very evidently superficial. These
phenomena accord with those of injections; for if they
succeed at all in children, the skin of the face and less
frequently that of the other parts, becomes almost entirely
black. Now this blackness is much more evident on the
external than the internal surface of the skin, no doubt because
more exhalants are found in the first than in the
second, which the arterial trunks only traverse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span></p>

<p>The preceding considerations evidently prove that the
texture of the internal surface of the chorion, and even
that of its interior, have a vital activity much less than
that of the external surface; that this texture is disconnected
with all the great phenomena which take place upon
the skin, with those especially which relate to the sensations
and the circulation; that it is in the papillÃ¦ that the
first are seated and in the reticular body the second; and
that it is almost passive in nearly all the periods of activity
of this double portion of the dermis. Its functions,
like those of the fibrous texture, suppose it to be almost
always in this passive state; they are only to defend the
body and to protect it from the action of external bodies.
It is this which forms our real covering; thus its properties
are well adapted to this use. Its resistance is extreme.
It requires very considerable weight to tear very
narrow strips of chorion, when it is suspended from them;
drawn in various directions, these strips are broken also
with much difficulty.</p>

<p>Yet this resistance is much less than when tannin is
combined with the chorion. We know that when thus
prepared, this portion of the skin affords the strongest
strings we have in the arts. I know but two textures in
the animal economy, which unite to such an extent suppleness
and resistance; these are this and the fibrous texture;
and this is a new character which approximates
them. We have seen that it requires a very considerable
weight to break a tendon, a strip of aponeurosis, or a ligament
taken from a dead body. The muscular, nervous,
arterial, venous, cellular textures, &amp;c. yield infinitely
more easily. If the dermoid texture had less extensibility,
it might advantageously supply the place of the
tendons, the ligaments, &amp;c. in the structure of the body.</p>

<p>Since the chorion is foreign to almost all the sensitive
and morbid phenomena of the skin, let us inquire then
in what part of the dermis these phenomena are seated.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
These parts exist very evidently on the external surface;
now we find on this surface, 1st, what is called the reticular
body; 2d, the papillÃ¦.</p>


<h5><i>Of the Reticular Body.</i></h5>

<p>Most authors have considered the reticular body as a
kind of layer applied to the external face of the skin between
the chorion and the epidermis, pierced with an infinite
number of openings through which the papillÃ¦ pass.
I do not know how we can demonstrate this layer, which
escapes according to the opinion of most of them, when
the epidermis is detached. In order to see it I have employed
a great many means, but no one has succeeded.
1st. Such is the adhesion of the epidermis to the skin,
that in a sound state we can hardly separate them without
injuring one or the other. Yet with the greatest precaution
we see nothing mucous on the chorion when it is laid
bare. 2d. A portion of skin cut longitudinally, especially
from the foot where the epidermis is very thick, allows
us to see very distinctly on the divided edge the boundaries
of this and of the chorion; now nothing escapes
from about the line which separates them. 3d. In ebullition
in which the epidermis has been removed, nothing
remains upon the internal surface, nor upon the chorion.
4th. Maceration and putrefaction, the latter especially,
produce upon the chorion a kind of glutinous layer the
instant the epidermis is removed. But this layer is entirely
the product of decomposition. Nothing similar is
met with in the ordinary state.</p>

<p>I believe, from all these considerations, that there is
not a substance deposited by the vessels upon the surface
of the chorion, extravasated, stagnant upon this surface,
and representing there a layer in the sense in which
Malpighi understood it. I believe that we ought to understand
by the reticular body, a net-work of extremely
fine vessels, whose trunks already very delicate, after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
having passed through the numerous pores with which
the chorion is perforated, come and ramify upon its surface,
and contain different kinds of fluids.</p>

<p>The existence of this vascular net-work is placed beyond
a doubt by fine injections which change the colour
of the skin entirely externally, without altering it much
within. This is, as I have observed, the principal seat of
the numerous eruptions most of which are really foreign
to the cutaneous chorion.</p>

<p>We may then consider the reticular body as a general
capillary system, surrounding the cutaneous organ, and
forming with the papillÃ¦ a layer between the chorion and
the epidermis. This system contains in most men, only
white fluids. In negroes, these fluids are black. They
have an intermediate tinge in the tawny nations. We
know how much the shades vary in the human race.
Hence the colouring of the skin resembles nearly that of
the hairs, which evidently depends upon the substance
existing in their capillary tubes; it is analogous to that of
the marks at birth, that are commonly called nÃ¦vi materni,
and in which we never see a layer of fluids extravasated
between the epidermis and the chorion.</p>

<p>Moreover, I think we know but little as yet concerning
this substance, which fills a part of the external capillary
system. It does not circulate in it, but appears to
remain there till another replaces it. When we examine
the skin of a negro, we see a black teint, and that is all.
In maceration I have observed that this teint is sometimes
removed with the epidermis, and that it sometimes remains
adhering to the chorion. It is very evidently
foreign to both, since both have the same colour in whites
as in blacks. It is never reproduced, after it has been
removed; for cicatrices are white in all people.</p>

<p>Is there in white people a white substance which, remaining
in the external capillary system, corresponds to
that of negroes, or does the colour of their skin depend<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>
only upon the epidermis and chorion? I have been
tempted to believe that they also have a colouring substance,
since the long-continued action of a powerful sun
evidently blackens them. This circumstance has even
made me believe that whiteness is natural to all men, and
that there was but one primitive race which has degenerated
according to different climates.</p>

<p>But in order to be convinced of the diversity of races,
it is sufficient to observe, 1st, that the teint of the skin is
but one of the characters which distinguish each race, and
that many others are always united to it. The nature and
form of the hair, the thickness of the lips and the nose,
the width of the forehead, the degree of inclination of
the facial angle, the whole appearance of the face, &amp;c. are
constant attributes which indicate a general modification
in the organization, and not merely a difference of the
dermoid system. 2d. White people become tawny in
hot countries; but they never acquire the teint of the
people of the country. 3d. Removed to cold countries
in early age, or even born in them, the blacks always remain
so; their shade hardly changes at all from generation
to generation. 4th. Colour by no means follows
temperature exactly; we see many varieties in the shades
of people who live under the same degree of latitude, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Every thing proves then that the colour of the skin is
but an insulated attribute of the different human races,
though it is that which is most striking to our senses, and
that we should not attach to it a greater importance than
to many others which are drawn from the stature, which
is oftentimes very small, as in the Laplanders, from the
broad and flat face, as in the Chinese, from the dimensions
of the chest, of the pelvis, the extremities, &amp;c. It is
from the differences of the whole, and not from those of
an insulated part, that the lines of demarcation should be
made which separate the races. The European face and
forms are in general the type with which we compare the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
exterior of the other nations. The ugliness or beauty of
the human races are, in our way of considering it, measured
by the distance which separates these races from
ours. Such is in fact the force of habit with us, that
we rarely judge in an absolute manner, and that every
object which is much removed from those to which we
are accustomed, is disagreeable to us and sometimes even
disgusting.</p>

<p>Besides, the colouring matter of the cutaneous reticular
body is more interesting to the naturalist than to the
physician. What should particularly arrest the attention
of the latter is the portion of the capillary system exterior
to the skin in which the fluids circulate. In fact, besides
the portion which is the seat of colour, there is evidently
another that the white fluids constantly pervade,
in which they are moved with more or less rapidity, and
in which they continually succeed each other. It is from
this portion that the exhalant pores arise which furnish
the sweat; it is this vascular net-work which is the seat
of erysipelas and of all the cutaneous eruptions that are
foreign to the chorion.</p>

<p>The blood does not penetrate it in an ordinary state,
but a thousand causes can at every instant fill it with this
fluid. Rub the skin briskly, and it reddens in a moment.
If an irritant is applied to it, whether it acts mechanically
like nettles, the appendices of which penetrate the epidermis,
or exerts a chemical action, like the frictions
with ammonia, or the action of fire when a portion of
skin is held too near it, instantly the sensibility of this
vascular net-work is raised; it invites into it the blood
which it formerly repelled; every part of a surface reddens
in proportion to the irritation. If passion acts powerfully
upon the cheeks, immediately a sudden redness is
evident in them. All rubefacients exhibit moreover a
proof of the great tendency which the sensibility of the
superficial capillary system of the dermis has to place<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
itself, if it be ever so little excited, in relation with the
blood which in the ordinary state is foreign to it.</p>

<p>Vesicatories depend upon the same principle. Their
first effect is to fill with blood the cutaneous capillary
system, where they are applied, to produce in it a sudden
erysipelas, and then to occasion a copious serous exhalation
under the raised epidermis. They effect in a few
hours what most cases of erysipelas do in many days; for
we know that most of them terminate by vesicles which
are raised above the skin. In burning, carried sufficiently
far to be more than a rubefacient, and yet not so as to
produce the horny hardening, there is also a sudden increase
of exhalation under the raised epidermis. In general
the production of every cutaneous bladder is always
preceded by an inflammation of the external surface of
the skin. This phenomenon is not exclusively confined
to this system. We have seen the serous, as soon as it
is laid bare and irritated considerably, redden in a short
time by the passage of the blood into its exhalants; which
constitutes an inflammation to which often succeeds a
copious exhalation of milky or other kind of serum.
This exhalation does not remain upon the surface, and
does not form vesicles there, because it has no epidermis;
this is the only difference between these phenomena,
which at first view do not appear to be the same in the
serous and cutaneous systems.</p>

<p>It is not only the irritation of the cutaneous organ which
makes the blood pass into the external capillary system.
Whenever the heart is powerfully excited and it accelerates
the course of this fluid, it always tends to go into
it; this is what is evidently seen, 1st, after violent running;
2d, in the hot period of a paroxysm of fever.</p>

<p>Upon this subject I will make a remark which appears
to me to be very important; it is that the capillary system
of the face is, more than that of all the other parts
of the skin, exposed to be thus penetrated with blood.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>
1st. This is evident in the two cases of which I have just
spoken, and in which the action of the heart is increased.
2d. In the passions, the skin remains the same in the
other parts, whilst that of the face suddenly becomes pale
or red. 3d. We know that physicians frequently examine
the state of the facial capillary system, which is
almost always affected by the state of the internal viscera,
and is full of blood or empty, according as it is sympathetically
influenced. 4th. In various kinds of asphyxia,
in those especially produced by submersion, by the vapour
of charcoal, by strangulation, &amp;c. the face is uniformly of
a violet colour from the passage of the black blood into
its external capillary system, into which it is brought by
the arteries. Oftentimes the neck and the upper part of
the chest are also livid; but there is never a discoloration
of the inferior parts. 5th. In many diseases, in which
death takes place by a kind of asphyxia, because the lungs
are the first interrupted, the dead bodies have a violet-coloured
and swollen face; this may be easily observed
by all who frequent dissecting rooms. There are a hundred
subjects in which the head has this lividity, to one
in which it is observed in the inferior parts. 6th. Most
cases of apoplexy produce the same lividity of the face.</p>

<p>To what is this extreme susceptibility of the facial
capillary system to admit the blood owing? Three things,
I think, principally contribute to it. 1st. The course is
already opened to this fluid, since the redness of the
cheeks necessarily supposes its presence in them, it only
increases in quantity; whereas when another part of the
dermoid surface becomes red, all the blood which enters
it is almost accidental. 2d. The anatomical arrangement
of the capillary system is more favourable to this
passage there than elsewhere; for it appears that the communications
of this system with the arteries of the chorion
are more free. What proves this is, that in injections
the face is coloured with great ease. There is undoubt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>edly
no anatomist who has not been struck with this phenomenon,
especially in children, in whom if the coarse
injections of our dissecting rooms succeed at all, the face
becomes wholly black, whilst the fluid penetrates but
very little into the other parts of the cutaneous system.
3d. It appears that there is a greater sensibility in the
face; in fact the same irritant brings blood there, which
does not make it flow to any other place. For example,
a blow equal to a box on the ear does not redden the skin
of the arm, whilst it suddenly inflames the cheeks.</p>

<p>The blood disappears from the facial capillary system
as it enters it; in an instant the passions will successively
produce there the bright red of a paroxysm of fever, the
whiteness of syncope and all the intermediate shades. It is
even the extreme ease with which this fluid penetrates this
system, that renders the face well adapted to serve as a
kind of picture, which the passions paint by turns with a
thousand shades, that are effaced, altered, modified and
return again according to the state of the mind.</p>

<p>I would observe upon this subject that the passions
have in the face three means of expression; 1st, the capillary
system, a means wholly involuntary, and which often
betrays what we wish to conceal; 2d, the muscular motion,
which, by contracting or expanding the features,
expresses the melancholy or gay emotions, and to which
belongs as effects, the various wrinkles of which we have
spoken; 3d, the state of the eye, an organ, which, as
Buffon has remarked, not only receives the sensations,
but also expresses the passions. The two last means are
to a certain extent voluntary; we can at least disguise
them; whereas we cannot deceive by the first. The
actor imitates anger, joy, &amp;c. because we can give these
passions by contracting the eye-brows, by dilating the
face in laughing, &amp;c. But it is the rouge of the actress
that imitates modest chastity; it is by removing this
rouge that she imitates the paleness of fear, horror, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span></p>

<p>I will add another essential observation in respect to
the facial capillary system; it is that it appears that its
tendency to receive blood, disposes it to become the more
frequent seat of many affections. We know, 1st, that
erysipelas is much more frequent in this than in other
parts; 2d, that the variolous pustules are remarkably conspicuous
here; 3d, that many eruptions are more abundant
here than elsewhere.</p>

<p>From all that we have just said, it is evident that it is
necessary to distinguish two portions in the capillary system
exterior to the chorion. 1st. One is constantly filled
with the colouring substance of the skin, a substance which
appears to be stagnant like that of the hair of the head,
and that of the hair of the body, which is subjected only
to the slow and insensible motion of composition and
decomposition and which never exhibits that sudden
increase or diminution of which we have just spoken.
2d. The second is constantly pervaded by many fluids
which continually succeed each other there, and which
constantly escape by transpiration, and which are replaced
by the blood, that insinuates itself into this portion of the
capillary system. These two portions are entirely independent,
and have probably no kind of communication.</p>

<p>It appears that at the instant of death there remains a
certain quantity of the white fluids in the second portion
of the exterior capillary system; the following experiment,
which I have frequently made, proves it; by plunging a
portion of skin into boiling water, and leaving it there an
instant, the epidermis is raised up, not as a whole as in a
blister, but in an infinite number of small vesicles which are
formed suddenly on its surface, and which contain a serous
fluid, that escapes as soon as we open these vesicles.</p>


<h5><i>PapillÃ¦.</i></h5>

<p>We call by this name those small eminences that arise
from the external surface of the chorion, and which,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
piercing the capillary net-work of which we have just
spoken, become by their extremities contiguous to the
epidermis. These eminences are very evident in the
palm of the hand and the sole of the foot, where they
are regularly arranged, in the form of small curved striÃ¦
in different directions. We see them through the epidermis,
notwithstanding its thickness in these places. But
they are seen especially when this has been in any way
removed, as by maceration, ebullition, &amp;c. If we cut
longitudinally a portion of the chorion of the foot, with
its epidermis adhering to it, we see between them along
the divided edge, a line in the form of a curved thread,
which arises from these small eminences placed at the
side of each other.</p>

<p>In some other parts of the skin, we distinguish the papillÃ¦
in a very evident manner; but in a great number, the
epidermis being removed, we see only a surface, slightly
uneven from some small eminences, especially towards
the orifices through which the hairs and the vessels pass,
but we do not discover those regularly arranged eminences,
the papillÃ¦ properly so called.</p>

<p>We must not mistake for them the numerous and very
evident prominences, which render the skin of some subjects
extremely rough. These prominences are formed
by small cellular, vascular or nervous bunches, by sebaceous
glands, &amp;c. which are found near the small openings
by which the chorion opens under the epidermis,
and usually transmits the hairs. These bunches, lodged
in the small oblique canals which are terminated by these
openings, raise the external side of them and thus form
this prominence. The following very curious experiment
proves this arrangement; when the skin is macerated
for two or three months, or even less, on the one
hand these little bunches in which there is almost always
a little fat, are changed into that white, thick, unctuous
matter, analogous to spermaceti, into which fat kept a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>
long time in water is always converted; and on the other,
the foramina enlarging, as we have seen, and the skin
changing into a kind of pulp, we can easily remove it all
around these little prominences, and see that they are continued
with the fat which fills the meshes of the subjacent
chorion, and which is also changed into a hard matter.</p>

<p>Injections have evidently proved to me that there were
vessels in these cellular bunches, and I have been convinced
of it for some time past by the dissection of some
subjects that died of scurvy, in whom the spots commenced
by very small ecchymoses, similar as it were to
flea-bites, and which occupied these little eminences. The
petechiÃ¦ of adynamic fevers have a different appearance;
but they belong also to an extravasation of blood in the
cellular texture, occupying the small pores which open on
the exterior of the chorion to transmit the vessels, the
hairs, &amp;c. The more prominent these eminences are, of
which we have spoken, the more uneven is the skin. In
general they are more frequent on the extremities and on
the back, than on the anterior part of the trunk. In the
extremities there are more of them in the direction of extension,
than in that of flexion.</p>

<p>We attach the idea of a beautiful skin, to that in which
these small tubercles are not found, and in which the
chorion is united at its external surface. Women have
commonly this last arrangement more evident than men.
The epidermis which covers these eminences very often
scales off at that place, especially from strong friction,
which contributes still more to render the skin uneven,
rough and harsh to the touch where they exist, which
might induce a belief that they are formed by it, though
it is always only accessory to them. Where it is very
thick, as in the palm of the hand and the sole of the foot,
it cannot be raised, and these small cutaneous tubercles
are never seen. In the face where many vessels pass from
within outwards, by the little pores of which we have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
spoken, we meet with hardly any more of them. The
papillÃ¦ scattered among these eminences, are in general
very slightly apparent in the places where they exist.</p>

<p>All anatomists attribute to these last a nervous structure;
they regard them as the termination of all the
nerves that go to the skin, and which, according to them,
are expanded to form these, after having first left their
external covering. Some even say that they have traced
filaments even into the papillÃ¦; I confess that I have
never been able to do it. In the ordinary state, the density
of the chorion and the extreme delicacy of the filaments,
are evidently an obstacle to it. In the state of
long continued maceration, in which the chorion becomes
pulpy and in which we might consequently trace these
filaments, were it ever possible, it cannot be done. I do
not however deny the texture attributed to the papillÃ¦.
The acute sensibility of the skin seems even to suppose
it; but it is only analogy and not demonstration, which
establishes this anatomical fact; indeed all the other
senses, whose organs are so sensible, have the portion of
them which receives the impression of bodies continuous
with a nerve.</p>


<h5><i>Action of different bodies upon the Dermoid Texture.</i></h5>

<p>In most of the other textures, we have only considered
this action in the dead body, because during life, these
textures always removed from external bodies, cannot be
influenced by them. Here we can regard it in a double
relation, since the skin is incessantly in contact with almost
all the bodies of nature.</p>


<h5><i>Action of Light.</i></h5>

<p>Light evidently acts upon the dermis. Removed from
its influence, men are blanched, if we may so say, like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>
plants. Compare the inhabitant of a city, who is never
exposed to the influence of the sun, with the peasant who
constantly is, and you will see the difference. It appears
that it is the light and not the heat which produces the
effect of which I have already spoken; for individuals
who live in a warm temperature, but removed from the
solar light, become white like those of cold countries.
Thus we know that some men who keep their chambers
always very hot, are whiter than others who, living in a
less hot atmosphere, are constantly exposed to the sun.
We might remain forever in a bath of a temperature
equal to the warmest seasons, and the skin would not
blacken. Apartments for study which are warmed with
stoves, and in which men remain as long as the labourer
at his plough, are as warm as the atmosphere of summer,
and yet the skin of those who occupy them never becomes
darker. Besides an irresistible proof is that the
clothing which does not prevent the action of caloric upon
the skin, and which offers a barrier to the rays of light
only, prevents the cutaneous colouring that takes place
upon the parts which the light immediately strikes, as
upon the hands, the face, &amp;c.</p>

<p>I do not speak of the solar influence upon the vital
forces of the skin, as in cases in which sun-strokes produce
erysipelas, or as when light is employed medicinally
to recall the life of a part; but it is only in relation
to the dermoid texture that I consider its action.</p>


<h5><i>Action of Caloric.</i></h5>

<p>The action of caloric upon the skin exhibits very different
phenomena, according to the degree of it that it is
applied.</p>

<p>1st. A warm atmosphere expands the dermoid texture,
increases its action, and makes most of the fluids which
form the residue of nutrition and digestion, pass off by
the exhalants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span></p>

<p>2d. When contracted by cold, this texture refuses to
admit those fluids, which then go off principally by the
urine.</p>

<p>3d. The insensible change from one to the other of
these two states, does not disturb the functions. When
this change is sudden, there are almost always alterations
in different organs, because the fluids destined to
pass out, cannot vary their direction as rapidly towards
this or that organ, as the cutaneous excitement produced
by the sudden changes from heat to cold.</p>

<p>4th. The skin resists a temperature much greater than
that of the body; it opposes an insurmountable barrier to
the external caloric, which tends to an equilibrium in animate
as well as inanimate bodies. Thus whilst these last
are penetrated with this fluid in a medium warmer than
themselves, and soon acquire the temperature of this medium,
living bodies remain at the same degree, how much
greater soever the surrounding heat may be to their own.
The curious experiments of the English physicians have
placed this truth, as it respects man, beyond a doubt. It
is unnecessary to give the detail of these well known experiments,
in which the mercury was seen to descend in
the thermometer, when the bulb was placed in the mouth
and in which the skin became covered, in a heated room,
with the aqueous vapours of the air, which the greater
cold of the body condensed upon its surface. A slight
attention to animals with cold blood, living in warm
climates, proves the same thing. I will make one remarkable
observation upon this point, it is, that most reptiles,
whose temperature is much less than that of the mammalia
and of birds, and who consequently are brought much
nearer than them to the temperature of winter, cannot
however support it. They become torpid and sleep in
subterraneous places, the heat of which remains nearly
uniform like that of cellars, and do not awake till the
milder temperature of spring stimulates them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span></p>

<p>5th. The skin, in very cold climates, seems to be on the
other hand an obstacle which prevents the internal caloric
from suddenly escaping and thus placing the body in equilibrium
with the surrounding medium. This is evident
in countries near the pole. Upon this subject an observation
the reverse of the preceding can be made; it is that
the cetaceous animals inhabit seas the temperature of
which is most unlike their own. Whales are sought for
especially in the latitudes of Greenland, Spitzbergen, &amp;c.
Why do fishes with warm blood delight in the frozen seas,
whilst the amphibious animals with cold blood prefer the
burning heat of the sun? I know not.</p>

<p>Let us observe that most of the internal organs when
exposed in solutions of continuity, have not the faculty
of preserving as well as the skin, a degree of independent
temperature. They become cold or hot sooner than it as
long as they remain healthy. The intestine brought out
of the abdomen in the operation for hernia, a muscle laid
bare, &amp;c. &amp;c. exhibit this phenomenon; thus in order to
give them this faculty of having an independent temperature,
nature inflames them, and they thus constantly preserve
their heat, whatever may be that of the surrounding
medium. The mucous surfaces next to the skin resist the
surrounding temperature the most, as is seen in prolapsus
of the rectum, in inversion of the anus, &amp;c. This difference
among the different systems is probably owing to
that of their structure.</p>

<p>6th. When the action of caloric is carried to a very
considerable extent, it begins to act upon the skin, and its
effects are the more evident in proportion as it is the
more intense. 1st. The slightest of these effects is to
produce an evident redness, a kind of erysipelas; the
caloric then acts like a simple rubefacient. 2d. The
second is to redden the skin and then to produce vesicles
on it. 3d. In the third there is a real horny hardening, a
crisping of the fibres of the chorion which contract, like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>
those of all the animal textures exposed to too strong a
degree of heat. 4th. In the fourth and last effect, the
dermoid texture is burnt, blackened and reduced to mere
carbon. These different degrees of burning arise only
from different degrees of caloric. I would observe that
in the two first effects, this fluid acts upon the vital forces,
and that these two effects cannot consequently take place
except during life. The two last are exerted only upon
the texture of the organ; thus they take place after death
precisely as before. Cooks often employ the horny hardness,
to give to the skin a hardness and brittleness necessary
in some kinds of cooking.</p>

<p>7th. Cold carried to a great degree acts also upon the
cutaneous organ, and produces different effects, according
to its intensity. The first of these effects is very analogous
to the first effect of a slight degree of caloric. It
consists of a kind of local inflammation. The tip of the
nose, the ears and the fingers, the cheeks, &amp;c. become red
from a slight degree of cold. I have not accurately observed
the other effects between this and the last, which
consists in a sudden privation of life. But there is this
difference between the gangrene that then takes place, and
that produced by a high degree of caloric, that the blackness
is sudden in this last, whereas it takes place only as
a consequence in the other. Observe in fact that there is
in gangrene two things which physicians do not sufficiently
distinguish, 1st, the mortification of the part; 2d,
its putrefaction. The mortification is always antecedent;
it is produced by a thousand different causes; sometimes
by the ligature of an artery, as in aneurism; sometimes
by that of a nerve; often by violent inflammation; sometimes
by a contusion, attrition, a bruise, &amp;c. Whenever
a part is dead in the midst of those which live, whatever
may be the cause of its death, it becomes putrid precisely
like a dead body, every part of which life has left. Putrefaction
takes place then even sooner, because on the one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>
hand the natural heat of the body, and on the other the
moisture of the surrounding parts, favour it remarkably.
This putrefaction varies according to the state in which
the part was at the instant of death. If much blood infiltrated
it, as when inflammation destroys life, it quickly
becomes putrid, blackens immediately and allows a fetid
sanies to escape; this putrefaction is called moist. If
there is but little blood in the part at the instant of death,
its putrefaction is less sudden; it first putrifies, then blackens,
and allows but little sanies to escape; this is the dry
gangrene. Thus in a dead body, if one part is much
loaded with blood, as the head of those that have died of
apoplexy, its putrefaction is much more rapid and moist
than that of the parts in which this fluid is less abundant.
In the gangrene which succeeds mortification produced by
cold, there is often dryness of the part, because there was
but little blood in it at death. How little many physicians
know of the progress of nature in the employment
of antiseptics, which they apply in the living economy,
as upon flesh without life. Antiseptics are applied for
one of two purposes, either to prevent the death of the
part, or its putrefaction. 1st. If it is with the first intention,
antiseptics should be varied. By untying the artery
of a limb of an animal that has been tied, you will perform
an antiseptic operation. Bleeding and emollient applications
which lessen the violence of inflammation in a
phlegmon, are antiseptics. A tonic as wine and all stimulants
which excite the vital forces in a part in which they
are languid after a bruise, are antiseptics. This word is
then extremely improper when it is applied to medicines
designed to prevent the mortification of the parts. Antiseptics
are employed to prevent a dead part in the midst
of living ones becoming putrid; some effect is obtained;
thus by sprinkling cinchona, muriate of soda, or any neutral
salt, by moistening a limb, a portion of skin, the ex<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>tremity
of the nose, &amp;c. which is dead from any cause,
the putrefaction will be arrested, as in a dead body upon
which the same means are employed. But what will be
the result of it? a little less fetor in the surrounding parts
and less danger of their receiving the influence of the
emanations of the dead part; but it is always necessary
that this should come off; antiseptics will never bring it
to life. Hence it is evident that these means should be
considered in two points of view entirely different. The
first prevent mortification, and vary remarkably though
they are designed to effect the same object; thus our
means of curing retention of urine are very variable, oftentimes
opposite, according to the cause which tends to produce
this retention. The others prevent putrefaction,
without restoring the parts to life; now these are uniformly
the same, whatever may have been the cause of
the local death.</p>


<h5><i>Action of the Air.</i></h5>

<p>The air acts incessantly upon the cutaneous organ. In
the ordinary state, it constantly removes from its surface
the sweat that is exhaled from it. Fourcroy, who has
paid particular attention to the solution of the transpired
fluid by the surrounding air, appears to me to have allowed
too much influence to this solution upon transpiration.
In fact there are two very distinct things in this function;
1st, the action of the exhalants which throw out the fluid;
2d, the action of the air which dissolves and evaporates
it. Now the first of these is wholly independent of the
other. Whether the fluid is dissolved or not, more is still
furnished by the exhalants. If the solution does not
take place, the fluid accumulates upon the skin, which remains
moist; but this moisture does not obstruct the exhalant
pores and prevent new moisture from being added
to it. A comparison will render this very evident. In
the natural state, the serous fluids are constantly exhaled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
and absorbed; the absorbents perform for them the functions
of the air which dissolves the sweat; now, though
these vessels cease to act, as in dropsies, the exhalants
continue their action; there arises only a serous collection,
which, though applied to the orifices of the exhalants,
does not prevent them from pouring out more
serum. The bladder in vain contains urine which presses
upon the opening of the ureters, these ducts do not pour
less into it. Though the mucous juices become stagnant
on their respective surfaces, new juices are however poured
upon these surfaces. So though the skin remains moist
from the want of solution of the transpiration, more
transpiration is nevertheless exhaled. Solution is a physical
phenomenon wholly foreign to the vital phenomenon
of exhalation. We transpire in a bath as well as in the
air; only the fluid which arises from it is mixed with the
water, instead of being reduced to vapour.</p>

<p>The moisture of the skin is owing to two causes wholly
foreign to each other; 1st, to the increase of the fluid
furnished by the cutaneous exhalants; now the action of
these exhalants may be increased from three causes.
First, every thing which accelerates the motion of the
heart, as running, the paroxysm of acute fevers, &amp;c.
drives to the skin, as it is commonly expressed. In the
second place, every thing which tends to relax and expand
the cutaneous organ by a direct action exerted upon
it by the surrounding bodies, increases also the action of
these exhalants, as in the great heat of summer, as in a
bath and after coming out, as in a heated room, &amp;c. In the
third place, the action of the skin is in many cases, sympathetically
increased. Here may be classed the sweats
of phthisis of which the lungs are the source; those of
fear, which depend upon a sudden affection of an epigastric
organ; those of many acute diseases, &amp;c. Now in
all these cases, however active the solution by the air may
be, the skin will be constantly moist, because there is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
thrown out upon it more fluid than the air can dissolve.
Thus in catarrhs of the lungs, in which more mucous
juices are thrown into the bronchia than the air can remove,
it is absolutely necessary that there should be cough
and expectoration to carry off the remainder.</p>

<p>2d. There are cases in which the moisture of the skin
arises from the solution not being sufficient. This is
what takes place in the moisture of the bed in which the
air is not changed, in damp weather, &amp;c. There is not
then more fluid exhaled; but the ordinary fluid becomes
evident, because it is not dissolved. It is under this point
of view that we must consider the action of the air upon
the cutaneous organ which transpires. It carries off
nothing in this organ; it has no real action upon it; it
takes only what its vessels throw off. Solution is merely
accessory, it is always subsequent to exhalation, and has
no relation with it. In the same day, in which the
temperature has remained the same, the skin is often dry,
moist, humid and even wet with sweat. If the air acts
upon transpiration, it is by contracting or relaxing the exhalants,
and not by dissolving what they throw out. If
the skin formed a sac without an opening, like the serous
surfaces, transpiration would go on though it was removed
from the contact of the air, the same as if in contact
with it. Why in fact should not that take place there,
which does upon these surfaces?</p>

<p>If we consider the action of the air upon the skin of
the dead body, we see that it produces two different
effects, according to the state of the body. If the air
penetrates the skin on all sides, it dries it, and it then
acquires a sort of transparency, like the fibrous organs,
unless a large quantity of blood had been accumulated in
it at the moment of death, in which case it becomes black
or of a deep brown. Thus dried, 1st, it is firm and resisting,
but can be bent in various directions without
breaking, as is the case with many textures thus dried, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>
the cartilaginous, the muscular, &amp;c. &amp;c. 2d. It is much
less easily altered than most of the other textures in a
dried state. 3d. It absorbs moisture less easily than
them, though however when immersed for a long time in
water, it finally resumes nearly its original colour and
loses its transparency. 4th. It does not exhale a very
disagreeable odour, like many of the other textures.
Hence why the skins of animals, merely dried, are used
in many of the arts; why some barbarous people make
use of them for clothing, &amp;c. The aponeuroses, and the
mucous, serous and fibrous membranes could not be thus
employed. It is to this also that must be attributed the
little alteration that takes place in the exterior of mummies,
which would never last for ages, if clothed with a
fleshy or serous covering.</p>

<p>When the skin is left upon the dead body, or exposed
to a moist air, it becomes putrid instead of drying. Then
it takes at first a dull colour, then a green and finally a
black one. It exhales a very great fetor, swells and thickens,
because the gases which are disengaged there fill the
cellular texture in its little spaces. A mucous covering
is spread upon its external surface, which is deprived of
its epidermis. Nothing similar to this covering is seen
on the internal surface. Finally, when all the fluids it
contains are evaporated, there remains a black residuum,
very different from that which is left after combustion.</p>


<h5><i>Action of Water.</i></h5>

<p>This action during life, is relative either to the substances
that are deposited on the surface of the skin, or
to the cutaneous texture itself.</p>

<p>The sweat deposits incessantly upon the epidermis
many substances, the principal of which are taken away
by the air, but many being slightly soluble in it, as the
salts for example, remain on its surface, and adhere to it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span>
when not removed by friction. Mixed with the unctuous
fluid which oozes out upon this surface, and with the
different foreign particles that the air deposits there as
everywhere else, these substances form upon the skin a
deposit which cannot, like the transpiration, be carried off
by solution. Now water removes all this deposit; hence
why the use of baths is truly natural. All quadrupeds
bathe themselves. All birds frequently plunge into the
water; I do not speak of those for whom this fluid is as
it were the element. It is a law imposed upon all species
of animals whose skin throws out a considerable quantity
of fluid. All the human races hitherto observed frequently
plunge into brooks, rivers, or lakes, along which
they take up their abode. The countries that are well
watered are those which animals prefer. They avoid
those where this fluid is wanting, or in which it is only
sufficient for their drink. We oppose nature in every
thing in society. In our own, numerous classes hardly
ever use a bath; thus you must seek especially in these
classes for cutaneous diseases. We have seen that the
mucous juices, remaining too long upon their surfaces,
irritate and stimulate them and cause there various affections.
Is it astonishing that the residuum of the cutaneous
exhalation which the air does not remove, should
occasion various alterations upon the skin? In summer,
baths are more necessary, because as many excretions are
taking place by the skin, more substances are deposited
there. In winter, in which every thing passes off by
the urine, the cutaneous surface becomes less dirty, and
has less need of being cleansed. After severe diseases,
in which there has been copious cutaneous evacuations,
one or two baths terminate the treatment advantageously.
Let us consider water then as acting as accessory to the
air upon the skin, as removing from its surface substances
which the first cannot dissolve, substances, which
varying remarkably like those that compose the urine,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>
have presented the transpiratory fluids to chemists, sometimes
as alkaline, sometimes as acid, oftentimes as containing
salts, sometimes charged with odoriferous substances,
&amp;c. Water is the general vehicle; when it is
evaporated, it leaves the substances that are not volatilized
like it. It is on this account that dry frictions are
also advantageous; they clean the exterior of the body.</p>

<p>As to the action of the bath upon the cutaneous texture,
we know but little of it during life. They say in
medicine that it softens, relaxes and unbends this texture;
this is vague language to which no precise meaning is
attached, and which is no doubt borrowed from the relaxation
which the skin of dead bodies undergoes, or even
tanned leather, when exposed to water. A bath acts
upon the vital forces of the skin, raises or diminishes
them, as I shall say; but it leaves its texture in the same
state; it is only that of the epidermis which it alters, as
we shall see.</p>

<p>Macerated in water of a moderate degree of temperature,
in that of cellars for example which does not vary,
the human skin softens, swells but little, becomes evidently
whiter, and remains for a long time without experiencing
any other alteration than that of a putrefaction
infinitely less than that of the muscular, glandular, mucous
textures, &amp;c. subjected to the same experiment.
This putrefaction, which removes the epidermis, appears
to be much greater on the side nearest to this membrane;
at the end of two or three months the skin loses but little
of its consistence. It does not become pulpy as the tendons
and muscles in this length of time when macerated;
it does not become a fetid pulp till the end of three or four
months. I have preserved some of it for eight months,
which has still its primitive form, but which feels liquid
under the fingers when pressed a little. In the half putrid
state, the skin still preserves the faculty of crisping
from the action of caloric; it moves about when placed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>
on burning coals, or when plunged into boiling water.
When once reduced to a really putrid state it loses this
property.</p>

<p>Exposed to ebullition, the dermoid texture when well
separated from the cellular, furnishes less scum than the
muscular, the glandular and the mucous; it resembles in
this respect the tendons, no doubt because being almost
wholly gelatinous, it contains but little albumen. In the
horny hardening that takes place a little before ebullition
commences, it twists and then always becomes convex on
the side of the epidermis, and concave on the opposite
side; and for this reason; the fibres of the chorion in
contracting by the horny hardening, are pressed against
each other; all the spaces which exist between them are
effaced; now, as these spaces are very large in the second
direction, the dermoid texture necessarily becomes more
contracted there, whilst in the first, the spaces hardly
existing at all, every thing being almost solid, the fibres
have less space to contract, they remain longer, and the
surface continues larger. In the natural state the cavity
of these spaces, being filled with cellular texture, increases
the extent of the internal surface; this space then
disappearing, this surface becomes contracted.</p>

<p>The moment this kind of twisting takes place upon the
skin, it is covered, as I have said, with an infinite number
of vesicles filled with serum, and which are formed by
the epidermis. As this membrane is very thick on the
soles of the feet, and the palms of the hands, it cannot
contribute in those places to their formation, and we see
nothing there similar to them. Yet by removing it from
feet that have been boiled, I have observed that it contained
between its layers many small vesicles, which were
scarcely visible. I have not analyzed the water of these
vesicles, but presume it is analogous to that of blisters.
Besides a greater or less quantity of it is poured out, and
the vesicles are consequently larger or smaller, according<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span>
to the state of the external capillary system at the instant
of death.</p>

<p>By the horny hardening, the skin becomes hard, elastic,
very resisting, thicker, but not so broad. It soon loses
its semi-transparency and yellowish colour, like the boiled
fibrous organs. Then the hardness it had acquired at the
instant of the horny hardening is gradually lost; it softens,
gives out much gelatine in the water in which it is boiled,
does not lessen in size, but even increases in thickness.
Every kind of fibre, vacant space and organization is then
gone; it is a membranous mass, homogeneous in appearance,
semi-transparent and gelatinous. In this soft state,
it does not lose the elasticity it had acquired in the horny
hardening, like the mucous, serous, cellular textures, &amp;c.
&amp;c. The great quantity of gelatine it contains still preserves
this property in it. The least motion that is communicated
to it produces a general trembling, a sort of
vibration of all its parts, exactly analogous to that of the
various kinds of animal jellies, half coagulated, which
vacillate in the vessel from the least jar.</p>

<p>Finally, the ebullition still continuing, the gelatine is
almost all dissolved, and there remains only a residuum
like membrane and which disappears with great difficulty;
it requires even a very long time for common boiling
water to reduce the skin to this residuum. Such are the
phenomena of the ebullition of the human skin as I have
carefully observed them. Chemists have paid great attention
to the dermoid texture of many other animals; they
have formed different ideas of its nature; they have admitted
that there are two substances in it; one fibrous
and the other gelatinous. I refer to their works upon this
point, particularly to the labours of Seguin, and the
work of Fourcroy; for in general I do not relate what
is detailed by others, it would be only a useless repetition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span></p>


<h5><i>Action of the Acids, the Alkalies and other Substances.</i></h5>

<p>The sulphuric, nitric and muriatic acids act upon the
skin, when in contact with it, as upon all the other animal
substances. I have remarked however that their action
is much slower, especially on the side of the epidermis,
though this membrane may have been previously taken
off. The first of these acids reduces it easily to a blackish
pulp; the others bring it to a pulpy state with more
difficulty, even when they are very little weakened; the
oxy-muriatic acid produces hardly any effect upon it.</p>

<p>Some authors have said that the lapis infernalis produces
the same phenomena on the dead as on the living
body. I wrapped up in a piece of skin, as in a rag,
many fragments of this substance, so that they were in
contact with the epidermis; at the end of a day they were
reduced to a kind of pap of a yellowish red, by the moisture
which they had absorbed. The dermoid texture,
crisped and contracted, had not been penetrated; it did
not appear even to have been injured on the exterior.
In general the action of the alkalies appears to be wholly
different during life, and it varies even according to the
different degrees of vitality. We know that flaccid and
fungous flesh burns much less easily than that which is
red and vigorous. It is the same with the acids. Never
during life do they produce any thing analogous to that
pulp of different colours according to the acids that are
employed, which is always after death the result of their
action.</p>

<p>We know that an alkaline solution, put in contact with
the skin, produces a kind of unctuous and slippery feel,
which is no doubt owing to the combination of the alkali
with the oily deposit of the skin, from which arises a sort
of soap.</p>

<p>I shall not speak of the tendency of the dermis to combine
with tannin, nor of the phenomena of this combina<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>tion;
I should only be able to repeat what others have
said upon this point. I will merely remark that it would
be very important to try the effects of tannin on the large
sub-cutaneous aponeuroses, the texture of which being
essentially gelatinous has much analogy with that of the
dermis, and which from their extent and delicacy might
serve for uses to which the dermoid texture when tanned
is less adapted. We know that the tanned skin is no
longer what it was in the natural state, and that the substance
with which it is then penetrated gives it an artificial
consistence. If much tannin has been combined with
it, it loses entirely the faculty of acquiring the horny
hardness, and becomes brittle; whilst if but little of this
substance is added to it, it preserves in part its suppleness
and the property of crisping from the action of
caloric. I would compare tanned skin to bone penetrated
with the phosphate of lime, and that which is not tanned,
to the cartilaginous parenchyma from which the acids
have removed this phosphate.</p>


<h4>II. <i>Parts common to the Organization of the Dermoid
System. Cellular Texture.</i></h4>

<p>The whole dermis is penetrated with a large quantity
of this texture. It is arranged in the following way;
from the exterior of the sub-cutaneous cellular layer, an
infinite number of elongations is detached which penetrate
the contiguous spaces of the chorion, enter afterwards
into those which are more exterior, and finally terminate
in the numerous pores which transmit outwards
the vessels, the nerves and the hairs, which have previously
passed through this cellular texture. We can
then consider the chorion as a kind of sponge, the spaces
of which represent the interstices, and which the cellular
texture penetrates on all sides; so that if it was possible
to separate by dissection, these spaces from the cellular<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>
texture, and the organs which are in it, there would be a
kind of sieve pierced in all directions. Art cannot arrive
at it but with difficulty on account of the delicacy of the
parts; but that which is not done by dissection, nature
often effects. In biles I have observed that all that which
fills the interstices of the dermoid fibres disappears by
suppuration, and that these fibres, separated besides by
the swelling of the parts, exhibit truly the appearance of
a sieve of which I have just spoken, when the fluid that
moistens them is removed. The bile differs in fact from
many other cutaneous eruptions, in this that it attacks the
cellular texture of the spaces of the chorion, whilst they
have their seat, as I have said, in the reticular body. I
do not know any acute affection which attacks the chorion
itself; all have their seat either on its surface, or in the
cellular texture of its cells. Its dense and compact texture
seems, like that of the aponeuroses, not able to be
changed until a length of time. In elephantiasis I have
seen this texture evidently disorganized.</p>

<p>M. Thillaye showed me portions of skin taken from a
cemetery, in which every thing that filled the dermoid
spaces had disappeared, and in which these spaces and their
dried fibres formed a real membranous sponge through
which the light could everywhere be seen. In this case
the reverse of what is seen in long continued macerations
had taken place, in which the fatty cellular texture,
changed into a solid, white substance, preserves, as I have
said, the form of the spaces which it filled, whilst the
dermoid fibres reduced to the pulpy state, are easily removed.
In the first case it is the mould only which is
left; in the second it is the substance which is contained
in it.</p>

<p>In chronic leucophlegmasia, the sub-cutaneous serum
gradually extends along the cellular elongations of the
spaces of the dermis, separates their fibres, consequently
enlarges these spaces, and sometimes penetrates even to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span>
the epidermis, which it breaks in different places, and
through the crevices of which it escapes. In this case,
there is not resolution of the skin into cellular texture,
as it is called, but a separation of the dermoid fibres,
which always remain.</p>

<p>I do not presume that the cellular texture of the chorion
extends to its external surface, under the epidermis; for
when this has been removed, fleshy granulations are not
formed, now, in all the parts where the cellular texture is
found, these granulations are produced, when the parts
are laid bare.</p>


<h5><i>Blood Vessels.</i></h5>

<p>The arteries winding in the sub-cutaneous cellular texture,
furnish an infinite number of small branches which
are introduced with the cellular parcels into the most internal
dermoid spaces, afterwards pass into those that are
nearer, approximate by winding and anastomosing a thousand
times through the spaces of the external surface of
the chorion, finally go through the pores of this surface,
and give rise to that external capillary net-work of which
we have spoken in the article upon the reticular body,
and to which in the ordinary state but very little red
blood comes. In this course through the dermoid spaces,
but few small arteries remain in the fibres of the chorion
itself, as fine injections prove. These fibres resemble in
this respect those of the aponeuroses through which many
vessels pass, but which have but few belonging to their
own texture.</p>

<p>The veins follow nearly the motion of the arteries, but
in an inverse direction. After having passed through
the dermoid spaces and the cellular texture which fills
them, they go to the great sub-cutaneous trunks, which
run a long course, form, as we have seen, a system wholly
distinct by its position from that of the arteries and which
can be often traced through the integuments. Not seen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
in the natural state, the venous ramifications of the spaces
of the chorion are considerably dilated in the subjacent
cancerous tumours, and make the skin which covers these
tumours appear to be marked with blue lines, which
always grow larger as the tumour increases. Whenever
there is a considerable distention of the cutaneous organ
by an aneurism, pregnancy, dropsy, &amp;c. this dilatation also
takes place, provided the cause of the distention pursues
a chronic course; for nothing similar is seen in acute
affections, whatever swellings may have taken place, as
in those consequent upon fractures, upon compound luxations,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>All the black blood formed in the skin goes into the
general venous system; no portion belongs to the abdominal.</p>


<h5><i>Nerves.</i></h5>

<p>Their distribution is nearly the same as that of the
blood vessels. Many very considerable branches, as
different divisions of the musculo-cutaneous, the internal
cutaneous, the lumbar, the saphena, the anterior tibial, the
intercostals, the cervicals, &amp;c. form a kind of sub-cutaneous
nervous system, from which go all the branches that enter
the dermis. These branches, in passing through the dermoid
spaces with the arteries and the veins, appear to
anastomose often together, go through the pores which
terminate the spaces on the interior, and no doubt form
the papillÃ¦. Observe even that on the hand where the
papillÃ¦ are very evident, there are, in proportion to the
surface, many more sub-cutaneous nerves than any where
else.</p>


<h5><i>Absorbents.</i></h5>

<p>Many absorbents creep under the skin; it is here that
they can be the most easily studied. All the veins are surrounded
with them; various fasciculi are observed in their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span>
interstices; so that a layer of absorbents, arranged in the
form of a continuous layer, seems to separate, in the extremities,
the aponeurosis and the skin. There is no
doubt that the origin of the most of these vessels exists
in the chorion, that they carry to the blood the fat and
the cellular lymph of its spaces, and the nutritive matter
of its fibres. But is there a particular order of branches
opening upon the surface of the epidermis to absorb in
certain cases foreign substances? This question cannot
be answered by anatomical inspection. But the following
considerations appear to me to throw great light
upon it.</p>

<p>1st. The sub-cutaneous absorbents, visible by injections,
are too numerous in proportion for the mere purpose
of carrying back the fat and serum of the neighbouring
parts.</p>

<p>2d. There are many medicines which appear to be
evidently absorbed; such are mercury in the venereal disease,
various purgative and emetic substances, febrifuges
even, as cinchona, which, when applied by friction, have
produced their effects as well as if taken by the stomach;
cantharides often act upon the kidneys, when the tincture
is used as a liniment, narcotic substances sometimes occasion
a weight in the head and drowsiness when they have
been externally applied, &amp;c. These different effects are
well known and many authors have given examples of
them.</p>

<p>3d. There is we know absorption of different kinds of
virus, of that of hydrophobia, of the small-pox, of the
venom of the viper, &amp;c. an absorption, it is true, which
rarely takes place when the epidermis is whole, but which
uniformly does, when this being removed, the matter is
found in contact with the external capillary net-work of
which we have spoken. I would remark even that the
different kinds of inoculation of the small-pox, of the
vaccine disease, &amp;c. evidently prove both the existence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
and importance of this net-work, to which heretofore sufficient
attention has not been paid. There are many contagious
principles which are absorbed through the epidermis;
such are those of the plague which the clothes communicate
and those of different pestilential fevers which
penetrate by the skin more than by respiration. I believe
cutaneous absorptions from which diseases arise may be
divided in the following way:</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr>
  <td class="hang" rowspan="2">1st. Absorptions which take place
  through the epidermis, and which produce an effect</td>
  <td align="center" rowspan="2"><span class="xl">{</span></td>
  <td class="hang">1st, local, as the itch, herpes, tinea
  capitis, &amp;c. &amp;c.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="hang">2d, general, as pestilential diseases,
  putrid fevers taken in an unhealthy
  place, &amp;c. &amp;c.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="hang" rowspan="2">2d. Absorptions which take place
  only when the epidermis is removed,
  and from which arises an effect</td>
  <td align="center" rowspan="2"><span class="xl">{</span></td>
  <td class="hang">1st, local, as the vaccine disease,
  the small-pox, &amp;c. &amp;c.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="hang">2d, general, as hydrophobia, the
   venom of the viper, a wound with an instrument impregnated
   with putrid matter, &amp;c. &amp;c.</td>
</tr>
</table></div>
<p>We see by this table that the absorbents when charged
with injurious substances, sometimes do not transmit them
beyond the part and sometimes carry them to the blood,
which conveys them to the different organs of the economy.
Some authors have thought that in those cases in
which the effects of the absorption become general, there
is rather nervous action and sympathetic phenomena, than
the transmission of an injurious matter into the circulation,
and that consequently the solids take almost an exclusive
part in these diseases. But to remove all doubt
upon this point it is sufficient to observe, 1st, that, in the
absorption of many contagious substances, for example,
when from the puncture of the finger with a scalpel impregnated
with putrid substances, a pain is produced,
there is even a redness along the whole course of the
absorbents of the arm, and the axillary glands afterwards
swell; 2d, that by transfusing into the veins most of the
substances that are applied in frictions, effects analogous
to those which take place in these frictions are produced.
Thus purgatives and emetics, transfused or absorbed, act<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>
upon the intestines and stomach the same as if introduced
in any other way. It seems to me that sufficient use has
not been made of the experiments of the last age upon
transfusions. By comparing their effect with that which
takes place upon the cutaneous organ, I think that it is
impossible not to admit a morbific principle in the blood,
at the time of contagious diseases.</p>

<p>3d. After the use of mercury taken in frictions, the
emanations of this metal from the animal fluids, act evidently
upon silver when placed in the mouth, the rectum,
&amp;c. I am persuaded even that the blood which in the
natural state exerts but very little action upon this metal,
would alter it then. Accoucheurs know that the waters
of the amnios of those women who have made use of
mercurial frictions exhibit the same phenomenon.</p>

<p>4th. Many substances that are not medicinal can be
transmitted to the blood by cutaneous absorption. Water
appears to enter it in this way, in the rapid production
of certain dropsies, in those cases related of travellers,
who wanting fresh water on the ocean, have in part
quenched their thirst by surrounding themselves with damp
clothes, &amp;c. When our garments are impregnated with
the oil of turpentine, the urine soon acquires an odour
that is owing to the principles transmitted to the blood by
absorption. Many judicious philosophers have asserted
that the weight of the body has been increased by a walk
in the morning.</p>

<p>I have observed that after remaining in the dissecting
room some time, the intestinal flatus frequently acquires
an odour exactly similar to that which the bodies in
putrefaction exhale. In the following way I convinced
myself that it was the skin as much as the lungs that
absorbed these odorous particles. I closed my nostrils,
and fitted a long tunnel to my mouth, which passing out
of the window allowed me to breathe the external air. The
flatus from my bowels, after I had remained an hour in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>
small dissecting room, at the side of two very fetid bodies,
acquired an odour nearly similar to theirs. I have observed
also that by touching for a long time fetid substances,
the flatus acquires more of this odour, than by
remaining only in an air loaded with cadaverous exhalations.
Then the absorbents carry at first these exhalations
to the blood, which afterwards throws them out by
the mucous surface of the intestines. Thus when the
urine is absorbed, the saliva, the mucous juices, &amp;c. have
an urinous odour.</p>

<p>I could accumulate many other proofs of cutaneous absorption;
but I have selected only the principal. Many
others have been cited; Haller in particular, to whom I
refer, has multiplied examples of it.</p>

<p>I would remark however that cutaneous absorptions
have a character of remarkable irregularity; that under
the same apparent influence, they sometimes take place
and sometimes do not. It is thus that most often we absorb
nothing in a bath, that we escape or take contagions,
that the vaccine disease is or is not communicated, that
the variolous inoculation is also often uncertain, &amp;c. This
is not astonishing. It requires a certain degree of sensibility
in the skin for the absorption of this or that substance;
above or below this degree, the absorbents repel
this substance. Thus in the intestinal canal, if you raise
by a purgative, the ordinary degree of sensibility of the
lacteals, they cease immediately for a time to take up
drinks, chyle, &amp;c. and every thing passes off by the anus.
Now a thousand causes act incessantly upon the skin; a
thousand irritants by turns applied to it make the degree
of its organic sensibility vary every instant, increase,
diminish and remove it from that which is necessary for
absorption. Is it astonishing then that this function
should exhibit so many varieties? Many modern philosophers
have produced numerous negative facts against
cutaneous absorption. What do these facts prove? only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span>
the varieties of sensibility which I have noticed; but they
do not destroy the mass of positive facts, generally acknowledged
and which together form a body of proof
which nothing can oppose. Thus we have seen the mucous
surfaces variable in their vital forces on account of
the variety of their excitants, vary also in their absorption.
If in the serous membranes, in the cellular texture,
in the work of nutrition for the organs, this function is
uniform, it is because being constantly in contact with the
same bodies, the surfaces where it is going on have an
uniform degree of organic sensibility.</p>

<p>Many facts, in relation especially to contagions seem to
prove that a state of weakness is favourable to cutaneous
absorption. 1st. Children and women absorb more easily
than strong and vigorous men. 2d. Many physicians
have observed that in the night in which the cutaneous
organ is in a state of remission in this respect, as it is not
stimulated by external objects, contagious diseases are
more easily taken. 3d. I have remarked that most of
the pupils who have fallen sick during my dissections,
had carried to their chambers portions of subjects, the
emanations from which had been able to affect them during
sleep. 4th. We know that practitioners recommend,
that persons should not expose themselves to contagious
miasmata during hunger, as the forces are then languid on
account of the emptiness of the stomach.</p>


<h5><i>Exhalants.</i></h5>

<p>The external capillary system which surrounds the
chorion and embraces the papillÃ¦, appears to be the origin
of these vessels, as it is the termination of the arteries of
the dermoid spaces. The exhalants take up their fluid
there, which they throw out upon the epidermis. We
have no anatomical knowledge as to their form, their
length, their course and their direction; but their exist<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span>ence
is incontestibly proved, 1st, by injections, which are
sometimes poured out upon the whole cutaneous surface;
2d, by the sanguineous exhalation which takes place in
some diseases in which there is a real bloody sweat; 3d,
by the natural sweat and by transpiration, which can evidently
have no other agents, though some authors have
admitted that there were certain pretended glands for the
secretion of these fluids.</p>

<p>An infinite number of calculations has been made to
ascertain the quantity of fluid which the cutaneous exhalants
usually pour out. We are dismayed when we
read the result of the labours of many philosophers upon
this point, when we go over the calculations, enormously
multiplied, of Dodard, Sanctorius, Keil, Robinson, Roye,
&amp;c. To what do all these calculations, for which the
life of a single man would perhaps be insufficient, tend?
To prove to us that when we start from a false principle,
the whole chain of consequences drawn from it is false,
though these consequences may be rigorously deduced
from each other. In fact, most philosophers have considered
the skin as a kind of fountain with numerous capillary
tubes, always throwing out in the same time the
same quantity of fluids, and being able consequently to
be subjected, like inert capillaries which pour out fluids,
to proportions and calculations of quantity. But the results
of these calculations have soon proved how mistaken
their authors were. Read these results, and you will see
that none of them agree, that frequently very great differences
characterize them. Is this astonishing? A thousand
causes make the transpiration vary at every instant.
Temperament, exercise, rest, digestion, sleep, watchfulness,
the passions, &amp;c. increase or diminish the action of
the cutaneous exhalants. I do not speak of the difference
from climate, seasons, &amp;c. which is still more decided.</p>

<p>An attempt has even been made recently to ascertain,
what belongs to the urine, to the transpiration, to the pul<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span>monary
perspiration and to the excrements, to calculate the
relation which exists between the quantities thrown out
in these four ways; useless researches! We might obtain
from them results for one man, which would not be applicable
to others. Thus see if we have ever been able
to make a single useful application to physiology or pathology
of all these immense labours on transpiration. What
would you say of a man who, during the days of the
equinox, in which the state of the atmosphere was every
minute changing, should try to establish proportions between
the quantities of rain which fell in every quarter
of an hour, or of one who endeavoured to fix relations
between the quantities of fluids which are evaporated in
given times, from the surface of a vessel under which
the intensity of the heat which warmed the water varied
every instant. The comparison is just. We might be
able to say in general, at the end of a given time, nearly
how many pounds of substances went from the body; and
yet this varies in every individual. But to attempt to
say in a general manner what, in this common quantity,
the urine and transpiration separately furnish, is to prove
that we do not understand the nature of the vital forces.</p>

<p>We have already observed, that all our knowledge
upon the varieties of transpiration, is reduced to some
general data; that, for example, in cold seasons and
climates, it is by the internal emunctories that the residue
of nutrition and digestion principally passes off, whilst in
warm climates and seasons, it is the cutaneous organ that
principally throws it out.</p>

<p>The skin on the one hand, and the kidneys and pulmonary
surface on the other, are then in this respect, in
a constantly inverse activity. Physicians very well know
this difference in regard to the urine and sweat; they
know that when one is increased, the other is diminished:
that in winter the urine contains principles of various
kinds, and that in summer the transpiration has a salt taste<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>
and other peculiar characters which it owes to the substances
which are foreign to it in the first season. But
they have not so well examined the relation of the transpiration
with the sweat; this determined me to make the
following experiments:</p>

<p>I wished to know what is the state of the respiratory
fluid in summer, in which there is much transpiration,
and in which all the heterogeneous principles consequently
go out by the skin. To obtain this fluid which is exhaled
in insensible vapour, I placed a clean, empty bottle
in a pail filled with ice and the muriate of soda, and I
respired a long time in it, taking care not to allow any
saliva to fall in. The parietes, chilled by the external
ice, condensed into small icicles the vapour of my breath,
on the internal surface of the vessel. When I had made
a certain quantity of these, I withdrew the bottle; then
by putting it into tepid water, the icicles immediately
melted, and I had in a liquid state my respiration, which
was before in vapour. Now I have been struck with two
things in this experiment, 1st, with the small quantity of
fluid that I was able to obtain, though I had respired for
an hour, and afterwards made two men respire each an
hour; 2d, with this, that most of the reagents have no
action upon this fluid. Nitric, sulphuric and muriatic
acids, lapis infernalis, and alkohol produce no effect when
mixed with it. In evaporating a small quantity in the
concavity of a watch chrystal, no residuum is left; placed
in a spoon over the flame of a candle, it experiences no
alteration from the heat. In a word, I have been almost
tempted to believe that it was nothing but water. I confess
however that this experiment ought to be carefully
repeated.</p>

<p>The little fluid obtained made me believe that the form
of the vessel was not well adapted to the purpose, because
it did not present sufficient surface and the vapour of the
lungs was too little divided. I took then the spiral cylin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span>der
of a small alembic which I surrounded with ice in a
pail; I made a man breathe through it, and I obtained in
fact more fluid, but infinitely less however than I expected,
considering the great cloud that is formed in winter
by respiration. In an hour, two ounces of fluid only
were condensed, which I weighed comparatively with
water, and found a little heavier, a proof that some principles
are mixed with its aqueous portion, and with which
I am unacquainted.</p>

<p>I am convinced that in winter I should have condensed
much more vapour; the inspection of an animal that
breathes proves it even, as I have just said. I am persuaded
also, that like the urine, the respiratory fluid is
then charged with principles which, during summer, pass
off by the skin, though I have not however any experimental
data upon this essential point, which I propose to
clear up the approaching winter. I think even that many
colds depend upon this. In fact, many of these principles
thrown out by the mucous surface of the bronchia,
not soluble in the air, like their aqueous vehicle, stagnate
upon this surface, irritate and excite a cough which throws
them off. On this account, we cough much in winter, as
we have often occasion to bathe in summer, when the
saline substances, which are accumulated upon the skin
by the exhalation that takes place there, cannot be evaporated
by the air. Hence why also in many affections of
the lungs, in which the mucous glands and the bronchial
exhalants do not increase the quantity of fluid they usually
pour out, but only separate with it, on account of their
change of organic sensibility, substances which the air
cannot dissolve, hence, I say, why in these affections there
is a constant cough; for, as I have said, when a substance
remains for any time upon the mucous system, it irritates,
and it makes an effort to get rid of it. I believe
that this elucidates the cause of many coughs, which have
been considered as nervous, on account of the small quan<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span>tity
of expectoration, and which are only a means that
nature employs to supply the want of the evaporation of
the air.</p>

<p>I think that physiologists have not paid sufficient attention,
either as it respects the bronchia or the skin, to the
part which can be evaporated, and to that which cannot.
Some animals seem to throw out more of these principles
that cannot be evaporated, than man; hence why it
is necessary to curry horses every day, and even to bathe
them often, in order to cleanse their skins which the air
would leave dirty. Fourcroy and Vauquelin have remarked
that there is never phosphate of lime in the urine
of these animals; this substance appears to pass out with
the sweat, and to be chrystalized on the surface of the skin,
from which it is removed by friction and water. I can
hardly conceive how the hairs can be the emunctories of
it; it appears to me to be more natural to think from analogy,
that it is by the sweat that it escapes. I presume
that the rain, in the natural state is as necessary to these
animals as to plants. The first do not avoid it; many
even expose themselves to it; it serves as a bath for them,
removes the saline particles the air does not dissolve, and
washes the skin.</p>

<p>The cutaneous exhalants do not appear to be everywhere
equally abundant. The face and chest contain
many of them; we sweat easily in these places. On the
back and the extremities they are less numerous. It is
rare that we sweat on the palms of the hands and the soles
of the feet. Besides this varies remarkably in different
individuals. I know two sisters, belonging to a family in
which phthisis has been frequent, whose chests are however
well formed, and who have never had any sign of an
affection of the lungs, and yet when they are warm they
always sweat from the chest. We know that in some the
sweat appears most usually in the face, and in others on
the cranium.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span></p>

<p>Have the nerves any influence upon the cutaneous exhalation?
In many cases of paralysis, the patients sweat
from the sound side. I have attended, for two months
past, a man at the HÃ´tel Dieu, who after an apoplexy,
had hemiplegia so that the left side of the body was immoveable,
and who only sweats from this side, so that
an evident line of demarcation is visible the whole length
of the median line. On one side the skin is dry, and
on the other it is very moist. I know cases are related
in which opposite phenomena have taken place; but they
do not destroy the observation that is uniformly made,
that the sweat takes place equally upon the sound and
the diseased side. Besides, who does not know that when
the nervous action is annihilated in a limb, a blister acts
upon it as usual? Do convulsions, in which the nervous
action is so much raised, increase cutaneous exhalation?
Have the states of extreme sensibility, in which all the
cutaneous nerves are so susceptible of receiving all impressions,
the least known influence upon sweating? Let
us acknowledge then that in cutaneous exhalation, as in
secretion, we know nothing of the nature of the nervous
influence, if it does exist.</p>


<h5><i>Sebaceous Glands.</i></h5>

<p>Besides the insensible transpiration and the sweat,
which are thrown out by the skin, this organ is constantly
lubricated by an oily fluid, which occasions, when
coming out of a bath, the water with which it does not
unite, to collect in small drops upon the body, which
greases the linen when it remains too long in contact with
the skin, catches the dust that is floating in the air, makes,
it remain upon the skin, and retains many foreign substances
coming with the sweat from without or within.</p>

<p>This fluid is in general much more abundant in negroes,
whose skin is on this account disagreeable, than in European
nations in whom it abounds especially in places<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>
provided with hair, particularly on the cranium. If left
without dressing, the hair becomes greasy, unctuous and
shiny; it seems even that this abundance of oily fluid is
destined to support their suppleness. Thus art imitates
nature in the preparation of it, and greasy substances
almost always enter into the dressings of the toilet. It
appears that there is less of this fluid in other parts where
there are hairs. It oozes in very small quantity from the
soles of the feet and the palms of the hands, no doubt on
account of the thickness of the epidermis. When we
wash these last, the water collects in small drops on the
back of them, and not in the palms, which are easily and
uniformly wet; there is never any of it deposited on the
surface of the nails. This cutaneous oil, retained in certain
places, as in the axilla, the perineum, the folds of
the scrotum, &amp;c. becomes mixed there with certain principles
of the transpiration, and often exhales a fetor that
is almost insupportable.</p>

<p>This oily fluid, of the nature of which we know but
little, is not like the transpiration or the fat exposed to
evident increase and diminution; it is always found in
nearly the same proportion. It appears to preserve the
suppleness of the skin, by preventing it from cracking.
The ancients sought no doubt to imitate its action over
the whole skin, as we imitate by pomatum its functions
in regard to the hair, by the oily unctions which they
made upon the body. This we know was much practised
among the Romans.</p>

<p>Whence comes this cutaneous oil? It can be furnished
from three sources, 1st, from transudation; 2d, secretion;
3d, exhalation.</p>

<p>Some have thought that the sub-cutaneous fat oozed
through the pores to form it; but the scrotum which is
destitute of this fat is one of the most oily parts. The
skin of the cranium, which is so to the highest degree,
is hardly at all fatty. That of the cheeks which covers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span>
much fat, is scarcely lubricated with it, &amp;c. In emaciation
the skin is often as unctuous as in corpulency, though
it is not always the case. Finally, in all the other functions,
physical transudation is proved to be nothing;
would it exist then here alone?</p>

<p>Those who admit the secretion of the cutaneous oil,
(and they are the greatest number,) place the source of
it in the small glands that are called sebaceous, and which
they say are every where spread under the skin. We see
some small tubercles upon the convexity of the ear, upon
the nose, &amp;c.; but in most of the other parts it is impossible
to distinguish any thing; we see only the small
eminences of which I have spoken and which make the
skin rough; now they have nothing in common with
these glands, the existence of which I do not deny, but
which I confess I have many times in vain sought for.</p>

<p>This has made me think that there is perhaps an order
of exhalants destined to separate the cutaneous oil, and
which is distinct from that of the exhalants which throw
out the transpiratory matter. There is in the cellular
texture exhalants for fat and others for serum. Certainly
no gland presides there over the secretion of the fat. It
is the same with the marrow which the exhalants of the
medullary membrane furnish. There is I think as much
probability in the supposition of the exhalation, as of that
of the secretion of the cutaneous oil.</p>

<p>Besides, we must not confound this oil, either with
that ceruminous matter which certain glands pour out on
the edges of the eyelids and behind the ears, and which
is forced out by pressure in the form of little worms, or
with that whitish substance that is collected between the
glans and the prepuce, and which is so evidently furnished
by small glands.</p>

<h3>ARTICLE THIRD.<br />

<small>PROPERTIES OF THE DERMOID SYSTEM.</small></h3>


<h4>I. <i>Properties of Texture.</i></h4>

<p>These properties are much developed in the skin.
The alternations of emaciation and corpulency through
which our organs, the limbs especially, pass sometimes
from a determinate size to one double or even treble, and
afterwards return to their primitive state, prove these
properties; and so do all the different tumours, deposits
of pus, external aneurisms, sudden engorgements which
accompany great contusions, aqueous collections in the
abdomen, pregnancy, scirrhi, numerous affections which
increase the size of the testicle, hydrocele, &amp;c. We see
in all these cases the skin at first extended and dilated,
then contracting when the cause of the distension has
ceased, and occupying the place in which it was originally
circumscribed.</p>

<p>The remarkable separation which the two edges of a
wound experience, that is made by a cutting instrument,
is owing to the contractility of texture. This separation
which takes place upon the dead body, proves what we
have already often remarked, viz. that the properties of
texture, absolutely inherent in the organic texture, are foreign
to the vital forces from which they only borrow an
increase of energy; thus the cutaneous retraction is much
stronger during life in a longitudinal or transverse wound.
But it is particularly in amputation that we observe this
increase of contractility from the vital action. No part,
not even the muscles retract so much as the skin; hence
the precept so much recommended in this operation of
saving the integuments as much as possible; hence the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span>
essential modifications that have been made in the ancient
methods. The muscular retraction is more sudden; but
this, which is more durable, ultimately prevails; so that in
the ancient mode of amputation, where every part was cut
at the same level, they had a conical stump, the summit
of which was formed by the bone, in which was next seen
the muscles, arteries, &amp;c. and in which the skin representing
the base, terminated on the side of the limb.</p>

<p>There are however many cases in which the dermoid
extensibility is less than it at first seems to be. For example,
in large sarcoceles, the skin of the neighbouring
parts of the scrotum being drawn, is applied upon the
tumour, and makes up for the extensibility that is wanting
in the skin of this part; that of the penis especially
is almost wholly employed to cover the tumour; so that
this organ disappears. It is to the limits placed to the
cutaneous extensibility that must also be referred the following
phenomenon; in a wound with loss of substance,
the fleshy granulations, in contracting by the evacuation
of the white substance that filled them, draw the neighbouring
skin in order to cover the wound; now this
drawing produces not only an extension but a real locomotion.
Hence why when the skin, naturally tense and
adherent, cannot yield to this locomotion, the cicatrices
are formed with so much difficulty, as we see upon the
cranium, the sternum, &amp;c.; why on the contrary on the
scrotum, the fold of the axilla, &amp;c. they take place with
so little; why in dissecting out tumours, it is so much
recommended to save the sound integuments, &amp;c.</p>

<p>When the skin is stretched, the fibres which compose
the spaces that have been spoken of, separate from each
other, and these spaces become broader. Their breadth
becomes especially evident on the internal surface of the
dermis; for as all the pores of the external surface pierce
obliquely its texture, the distension of this texture only
diminishes the length of the small canal they form, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>
does not enlarge the orifice of it; thus whilst the internal
surface contains interstices of considerable size, this remains
uniform, but allows us to see these interstices,
which render it more transparent where they exist; hence
that appearance like marble on the skin of the abdomen
of women who have had many children.</p>

<p>When the skin is contracted, the internal spaces are
drawn together and even effaced. The external surface
which has none of these, cannot diminish so much in
breadth, so that there is a disproportion in the breadth of
the internal and external surface; hence, as I have said,
the convexity of the latter in the horny hardening produced
by boiling water; hence also the inequalities and
external roughness which takes place when cold acts
powerfully upon us, and which contracts the dermoid texture.
Besides, this phenomenon only takes place when
the contractility is evident in the ordinary state; for if
there has been previous distention, the cells already enlarged,
return only in contracting to their natural state,
and there is no disproportion in the extent of the internal
and external surfaces of the skin.</p>

<p>In most of the extensions, there is a diminution of the
thickness of the dermoid texture. It is only when it is
dilated by the infiltration of water in its spaces, as in leucophlegmasia,
that it increases in thickness by diminishing
in density. In chronic inflammation, in engorgement,
and in various alterations of which the dermoid
texture is the seat, it loses in part the faculty of stretching;
it breaks with ease when it is distended. This is
what happens in some aneurisms, in those of the aorta
especially that have produced an absorption of the sternum.
A slow inflammation seizes upon the skin that
covers the tumour, and it breaks with a degree of distention
infinitely below what it bears in a sound state, if the
death of the patient does not prevent this fatal rupture,
two examples of which I have seen in the ward of lying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span>
in women at the HÃ´tel Dieu. In this state of inflammation,
the distention is very painful, whilst it is not so in
the ordinary state.</p>

<p>The skin loses also its contractile power in most of the
chronic affections of which it is the seat, and which alter
its texture.</p>

<p>Are there some days in which the skin is more contracted,
and others in which it is looser and more expanded?
I believe so, from observing the marks left after small-pox,
which are much more apparent and deeper some days
than others.</p>


<h4>II. <i>Vital Properties.</i></h4>

<p>These are strongly marked in this system. We might
say, that nature by giving an excess of life to this dermoid
covering, has wished to establish a striking line of demarcation,
and to make us perceive the difference between
the inorganic bodies with which its external surface is in
contact, and the organized textures that its internal surface
covers. I shall consider these vital properties as in
all the other systems; some belong to animal life and
others to organic.</p>


<h5><i>Properties of Animal Life.</i></h5>

<p>The animal sensibility exists in the highest degree in
the skin. It presides over the feeling, which is more
acute and delicate there than in most of the other textures.
It is also the cause of touch, a double function
which is very different.</p>

<p>The feeling is the faculty of perceiving the impression
of the surrounding bodies. It gives us the sensations of
heat and cold, moisture and dryness, hardness and softness,
&amp;c. It has relation then, 1st, to the existence; 2d,
to the general modifications of external bodies. Its exercise
precedes that of all the other senses which cannot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span>
be exercised until after its action. It is necessary to the
sight, to hearing, smelling and the taste, as it is to the
touch. It depends only upon a particular modification of
the animal sensibility; it is nothing but this property
considered in exercise. Thus when the particular modifications
of this sensibility which preside over the other
senses have been destroyed, when the eye is insensible
to light, the ear to sounds, the tongue to tastes and the
pituitary membrane to odours, these different organs still
preserve the faculty of feeling, both the presence of bodies
and their general attributes.</p>

<p>The touch has only relation to the particular modifications
of bodies; it is the source of our notions upon their
external forms, their dimensions, size, direction, &amp;c. It
differs essentially from the four other senses.</p>

<p>1st. In this, that it does not require, like the feeling,
any particular modification of sensibility. The hand is a
little more sensible than the rest of the skin; but there
is not a great difference, and we should touch bodies
almost as well, if that of the abdomen covered the phalanges.
On the contrary, each sense has a peculiar sensibility
which places it exclusively in relation with a determinate
body in nature. The pituitary membrane would
be struck by light in vain, if placed at the bottom of the
eye like the retina; the palatine membrane if it lined the
nasal fossÃ¦, would not perceive odours, &amp;c.</p>

<p>2d. The touch is exercised only upon masses, more or
less considerable parcels. The other senses are brought
into action by the insensible and infinitely multiplied particles
of bodies, as the luminous, savoury particles, &amp;c.</p>

<p>3d. Most of the other senses do not require the previous
exercise of the will. Odours, light and sounds strike
upon their respective organs, and often produce, without
our attending to them, their respective sensations. It is
the same with feeling; the will most commonly has no
part in it. It is exercised because we live in the midst of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span>
many excitements. We do not most often seek for the
causes of general sensations; they are those that come
and act upon us. On the contrary, the touch requires to
be produced by an act of the will. It is exerted in consequence
of the exercise of the other senses; it is because
we have seen, heard or felt an object, that we touch it.
We confirm or correct by this sense the notions, which
the others have given us. Hence why it is, as it were,
dependant on them. The more they are contracted, the
less frequently is it exercised. The blind, the deaf, &amp;c.
have less desire to touch than him, who has all his sensitive
gates open to the impression of external bodies.</p>

<p>4th. Most of the other senses require a peculiar structure
as well as a peculiar sensibility in the organs which
compose them. On the contrary, the touch only requires
a particular form in its organs. Provided that these have
on the one hand animal sensibility, and on the other can
embrace by many points external objects, they can distinguish
their tangible qualities. The touch will be obscure
if we grasp bodies in one or two directions only;
yet it will take place. Thus we touch with the hollow
of the axilla, the bend of the arms, hams, &amp;c. with the
lips and with the tongue. Thus the elephant touches with
his trunk, reptiles by twining themselves around bodies,
most animals with their snouts, &amp;c. But the more the
points of contact are multiplied, the more perfectly is the
sense exercised. The hand of man is in this respect the
most advantageously formed; it proves that he is better
adapted to communicate with what surrounds him than all
other animals; that the empire of his animal life is naturally
much more extended than that of theirs; that his
sensations are more accurate, because they have a means
of perfection that theirs have not; and that his intellectual
faculties are destined to have an infinitely greater
sphere, since they have an organ infinitely better than
theirs to perfect them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span></p>

<p>The sensibility of the skin resides essentially, as we
have seen, in the papillary body; it is there that all the
great phenomena relative to sensation take place. It is
this portion of the skin that truly belongs to animal life,
as the reticular body is, on account of the vascular plexus
that forms it, the portion essentially dependant on organic
life. The chorion being as it were passive, remains
foreign to every kind of important function, and serves
only for a covering.</p>

<p>The extremely acute sensibility of the papillary body
requires a covering to defend it from strong impressions.
This covering is the epidermis. When it is removed,
every touch is painful; the impression of the air even is
very much so; it is this removal of the epidermis that
produces the smarting that is felt when a blister is taken
off. Observe in fact that smarting is a very frequent kind
of pain, which the animal sensibility of the skin occasions
when more raised than usual. This term<a id="FNanchor_1_1" href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> is borrowed
from burns, which, when they are only to a certain
extent, acting nearly like blisters, lay the papillÃ¦
bare; now as it is always the skin which is exposed to
the action of fire, we transfer to all burnt organs the ideas
which we attach to the word smarting. But the pain is
far from having the same character in the other systems;
this peculiar one belongs only to the dermoid, in which
it takes place from a burn, erysipelas, after a blister, &amp;c.
and during all inflammations that have their seat in the
reticular body. No other system when inflamed gives us
this sensation. The pain is throbbing in the cellular; it
exhibits a wholly different modification in the muscular,
when it is the seat of acute rheumatism, &amp;c.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_1_1" href="#FNanchor_1_1" class="label">1</a>
In order to understand this sentence it should be observed that the
word which I have translated smarting is <i>cuisson</i>, which means the
action of fire upon animal bodies, and is also used for the painful sensation
which this action produces.â€”<span class="smcap">Tr.</span></p></div>

<p>There is another kind of pain which is also peculiar to
the cutaneous system; it is itching, which is the first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span>
degree of smarting. We remove it by a gentle friction,
which exciting in the papillÃ¦ a different sensation, effaces
that of which they are then the seat; but when this new
sensation has passed off, the former one, which is occasioned
by a permanent cause, is reproduced and requires
a new friction; there happens then in a small way, what
we observe in a large one, when a stronger pain makes
us forget one that is weaker. No other system in the
economy exhibits this kind of pain, so frequent in itch,
herpes and many other cutaneous eruptions. In their
tubercular inflammations, the serous membranes become
the seat of white eruptions, analogous to many of those
of the skin; the mucous surfaces are also often affected
with many small pimples; now this sensation is never
manifested in either of them.</p>

<p>There is also a sensation which appears to be the minimum
of that pain of which smarting is the maximum;
it is tickling, a mixed sensation, an hermaphrodite, as an
author has called it, which is agreeable when carried to
a certain degree and painful beyond it. Carry the fingers
lightly over a mucous or serous surface, a muscle or a
nerve laid bare; an analogous sensation will never arise
from the contact.</p>

<p>The animal sensibility of the skin is, like that of the
mucous surfaces, subjected to the essential influence of
habit, which can transform successively into indifference
or even into pleasure, what was at first painful. Every
thing that surrounds us furnishes constant proof of this
assertion. The air in the succession of the seasons, caloric
in the numerous varieties of the atmosphere, in the
sudden change from one temperature to another, water in
a bath, in the moist vapours with which the medium is
loaded in which we live, our garments of which some, as
those of wool, are at first very painful, every thing which
acts upon the skin by mere contact, produces sensations
in it which habit continually modifies. Observe the mode<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span>
of dress of different nations; in some, all the superior
extremities are bare; in others, the fore-arm only appears;
the inferior extremities, either in whole or part,
are naked in others; in some, a more or less considerable
portion of the trunk is left exposed to the air, and among
the savages, nothing is covered. The portions which in
each people remain naked, bear the contact of the air,
without giving any painful sensation. Let them expose, on
the contrary, parts usually covered, especially if it is cold,
and at first pain will be the consequence of it; then the
parts gradually becoming accustomed to this contact, will
get to be insensible to it. There has been much said
latterly of the danger of the Grecian costumes, of the
nudity of females, &amp;c. I do not speak of the morality of
them; but every thing that is reprehensible physiologically
is, that the progress of the fashion has been more
rapid than that of the sensibility. If they had exposed
at first the neck, then a little of the chest, then the bosom,
&amp;c. habit would by degrees have given a new modification
to this property, and no accident would have resulted
from it. But in going suddenly from a costume in which
every part is covered, to that in which the superior half
of the chest, either before or behind, remains naked, is it
astonishing that colds, catarrhs, &amp;c. should be the result
of it?</p>

<p>Habit extends its empire, in relation to the skin, even
to our manners themselves. Decency is in this respect
a thing of comparison. An Indian woman, with nothing
but a narrow cloth around the pelvis, would be with us
an object at which the public modesty would be shocked.
The habit of mankind serves her as a veil in her own
country. A female savage transported entirely naked to
the same country, would be indecent there; she is not so
in her own. Observe our fashions in their rapid succession;
a woman, who by not changing her costume, would
have had two years since, that of a courtezan, would now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span>
find herself dressed with great modesty. Indecency in
costume is that merely which shocks our habit. The
female Indian, with the rag that covers only a quarter of
her body, is more decent than the woman in whom a
small opening separated the neck-handkerchief in our old
fashions. The sight of the face shocks those people among
whom females are veiled. Let us consider then habit as
the type of the decency of costumes. Nature has wished
in physiology, that the phenomena over which it presides,
should be slowly connected; it is the same in morals.
The woman who suddenly changes her dress from one
that is close to one that is not, exposes herself to painful
sensations, to catarrhal diseases, &amp;c. and shocks the eyes
of those who had been accustomed to see her in a different
exterior. When the change is gradually and insensibly
brought about, neither health nor morals are affected.</p>

<p>Habit does not modify the cutaneous sensibility which
arises from an alteration of texture, from an inflammation,
&amp;c. Powerfully raised in this last state, it is much above
its natural level. Then the least contact becomes extremely
painful; thus the skin is no longer then in a state
to exercise the sense of feeling. The touch itself does
not distinguish general sensations. All bodies make a
common and uniform impression, it is that of pain.</p>

<p>The animal sensibility of the skin sometimes diminishes
and even disappears; paralysis is a proof of this.
These affections, more rare than the loss of motion, often
however take place. In the organs of the senses, it is
the eye which most frequently loses the sensation; the
ear comes next, then the skin, then the nostrils and finally
the tongue, which is the sensitive organ that is always
most rarely paralyzed, no doubt because it is that which
is the most connected with the support of organic life,
without which we could not exist. The others belong
especially to animal life, which we can lose in part without
ceasing to exist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span></p>

<p>The whole skin is never at the same time paralyzed;
there is rarely even hemiplegia in this respect; the feeling
is not extinguished but in an insulated part. I would
remark that the existence of these paralyses is also a
proof of the want of nervous influence upon cutaneous
exhalation and the capillary circulation, since both go on
very well in this case as well as in paralysis of motion, as
I have observed above. Cut the nerves of a limb of an
animal, in order to render this limb insensible; if after
this you apply an irritant, the skin will inflame as usual.</p>

<p>When the animal sensibility is in exercise, is there a
kind of erection of the papillÃ¦ that they may feel more
acutely? The same observation may here be made as was
in regard to the mucous surfaces. This erection is an ingenious
idea of some physicians, and not a fact which
rests upon observation. I even think that this contradicts
it; for examined with a glass the papillÃ¦ appear to
be constantly in the same state. Why should not the
skin feel like a nerve laid bare, like the eye, the ear, &amp;c.
in which these sorts of erections have never been imagined?</p>

<p>Animal contractility is wholly foreign to the cutaneous
organ, which moves voluntarily only by the influence of
its fleshy pannicle.</p>


<h5><i>Properties of Organic Life.</i></h5>

<p>Organic sensibility and insensible contractility exist in
the highest degree in the cutaneous organ. The external
capillary system, which forms the reticular body, is, as I
have said, especially the seat of these properties. They
are in constant activity in order to preside, 1st, over the
capillary circulation; 2d, over exhalation; 3d, over absorption;
4th, over the nutrition of the whole dermoid
texture; 5th, over the secretion of the cutaneous oil, if
the sebaceous glands exist. It is not astonishing that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span>
these properties should be so much developed in the skin,
in which they have so many functions to support. Add
to these considerations the constant action of external
bodies, an action which keeps this organ in continual
excitement, which incessantly stimulates its sensibility,
which is to this sensibility what that of the bodies contained
in the mucous surfaces is to the sensibility of these
surfaces; the irritation is even more sensible, because the
stimuli are oftener changed. A thousand agents of nature,
of different density and composition continually succeed
each other on the exterior of the body, and at the same
time that they act upon the animal sensibility of the skin,
to produce various sensations, they excite the organic sensibility
in order to support the functions over which this
sensibility presides.</p>

<p>Is it astonishing then that the greater number of cutaneous
diseases supposes an alteration in this property
and in the insensible organic contractility which is not
separated from it? I divide these diseases into four classes,
according to the structure we have distinguished in the
skin.</p>

<p>1st. There are diseases of the papillÃ¦; these are the
paralyses and various kinds of increase of feeling, which
reside only in the nerves. Women are especially subject
to these last, which are so great in some nervous affections,
that mere contact of the skin if considerably powerful
produces convulsions. To this also should be referred
the extreme susceptibility of some individuals in
whom tickling produces a general revolution. It is
necessary to distinguish these exaltations of animal sensibility,
from those of which we have spoken above, and
which depend upon inflammation. The organic sensibility
is especially affected in these last; we might say
that by its increase it is transformed into animal sensibility;
whereas in the other case this last property alone
is altered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span></p>

<p>2d. There are diseases which have evidently their seat
in the cellular texture which occupies the dermoid spaces;
such are the inflammations of the cutaneous portion which
covers a phlegmon, a bile, &amp;c.</p>

<p>3d. There are diseases of the external capillary net-work,
from which the exhalants arise. To this must be
referred erysipelas, many species of herpes, measles, scarlatina
and many acute cutaneous eruptions that are daily
met with in practice.</p>

<p>4th. Finally, there are diseases in which the chorion is
affected. Elephantiasis, and in general many chronic
cutaneous diseases appear to me to be of this number, and
I will even observe that the chorion never appears to be
primarily affected in acute diseases. The obscurity of its
vital forces, its dense and compact texture, and its comparative
want of vessels prevent it from accommodating
itself except to chronic affections. In phlegmonous erysi
pelas, in biles, &amp;c. it is only influenced, but it is not
essentially diseased. Thus we have seen that all the affections
of the osseous, cartilaginous, fibrous, fibro-cartilaginous
systems, &amp;c. are really slow and chronic, on account
of the texture and the vital obscurity of these systems.</p>

<p>Now if we reflect on this division of cutaneous diseases,
we shall see that except those of the first class,
which are not numerous and which consist in greater or
less alterations of animal sensibility, we shall see, I say,
that all the others suppose a more or less considerable
affection of the organic sensibility and of the corresponding
insensible contractility. All are derived from an increase,
a diminution or an alteration of these properties.</p>

<p>It is also to the different changes of these properties,
that must be referred the more or less copious sweats and
the various exudations of which the skin is the seat. In
fact, the exhalant vessels remain always the same in relation
to their structure. Why then do they admit a greater<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span>
or less quantity of fluids? Why at certain times do they
allow of the passage of substances, which they repel at
others? It is because the modifications of their organic
forces are changed. These forces are often weakened in
an evident manner in diseases; they become languid and
are prostrated. Then blisters are applied in vain; the
organic sensibility no longer answers to the excitement
that is made upon it. This is a striking phenomenon in
ataxic fevers, and proves the independence of the phenomena
of cutaneous exhalation, capillary circulation, &amp;c.
in regard to the cerebral nerves. In fact, whilst during the
paroxysm the brain is in extreme excitement, the voluntary
muscles are put by this excitement into a violent
state of convulsion, and the energy of the whole of the
animal life seems to be doubled before it ceases to exist,
the organic is already in part exhausted; the functions of
the portion of the skin which belongs to this life have
already ceased.</p>

<p>The stimuli of cutaneous organic sensibility vary remarkably
in their degree of intensity. 1st. The strongest
are fire, cantharides, the alkalies, the acids sufficiently
diluted by water not to act but upon the vital forces and
not to alter the dermoid texture by the horny hardening,
the juices of many acrid and corrosive plants, certain
fluids even produced in the economy, as those of cancers,
&amp;c. All these stimuli redden the skin when they are
applied to it. 2d. Most of the same stimuli, diminished
in intensity, stimulate it but slightly. 3d. Finally, aqueous
fluids, cataplasms and emollient fomentations seem to
produce this excitement the least; they even rather
weaken the cutaneous organic sensibility; they seem to
act upon it like sedatives and moderate the kind of excitement
it produces in inflammations. The same is true of
most of the fatty substances; thus oils, butter, grease, &amp;c.
are in general not calculated to keep up the suppuration
of blisters. It is requisite, in order to keep the skin at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span>
the degree of organic sensibility, necessary for the purulent
exudation that then takes place, to mix cantharides
with fatty substances.</p>

<p>The skin does not appear to enjoy sensible organic contractility.
Stimuli usually produce no other action upon
it, than the contraction imperceptible to the eye, which
composes insensible contractility, and which takes place
especially in the small capillary vessels. There is however
one circumstance in which this contraction is, to a
certain extent, apparent; it is when cold acts briskly
upon the skin, which it wrinkles into goose flesh, as it is
called. I have pointed out above the mechanism of this
contraction, of which the chorion is the seat, and which
holds a medium, like many motions which I have already
had occasion to notice, between the two species of organic
contractility.</p>


<h5><i>Sympathies.</i></h5>

<p>We shall still follow the division of the sympathies
into active and passive, a division which is more remarkable
here than in most of the other systems, because the
sympathies are much more numerous.</p>


<h5><i>Passive Sympathies.</i></h5>

<p>The animal sensibility is very often brought into action
in the skin, by the affections of the other systems. We
know that the application of cold to the sole of the foot
frequently produces affections of the head; that in many
cases, the different species of itching, and even of smarting
appear without an injury of the part where the pain
is felt. It is useless to cite examples that are known to
all physicians. I will confine myself to the sympathies of
heat and cold alone, which have not yet been spoken of.</p>

<p>I call by this name the sensation that is experienced
upon the skin, when there is not a superabundance or
absence of caloric there. There is evidently a material<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span>
cause for the heat in inflammation and for the cold in the
ligature of a great artery. On the contrary, in the cases
of which I spoke, it is but an aberration of the internal
sensitive principle, which resembles that which takes
place when we refer the pain to the extremity of an
amputated limb. This is what occurs in many cases
of shivering, in which the internal sensitive principle
refers to the skin a sensation of which the cause does not
exist. By approaching the fire then we do not become
warm, because we really were not cold; but we only destroy
by a real sensation, the opposite sensation which is
illusory that we experience, or rather we turn the perception
from this sensation. We know that at the instant
of the ejaculation of semen, a sudden and sympathetic
chill often extends over the body. We know the
cold of fear, which almost always arises, like the sweat
produced by this passion, from the sympathetic action
exerted upon the cutaneous organ by an epigastric organ
affected by the passion.</p>

<p>Observe what takes place in the beginning of most acute
local diseases, as in those of the serous and mucous surfaces,
of the lungs, of the gastric viscera, &amp;c. &amp;c. The
organ which is to be the seat of the disease is at first
affected; immediately many sympathetic and irregular
symptoms arise in all those which are sound; this is the
affection that precedes. When the disease is once developed,
and it follows its periods, a new order is established,
as it were, in the economy. The relations of the
organs seem to change. In the preternatural irregularity
of the functions, a kind of regular assemblage of symptoms
is manifested, it is this assemblage which characterizes
the disease and distinguishes it from every other in
which a different order of morbific relations is established
between the functions; now the passage from the natural
to the preternatural relation of functions is marked by a
thousand vague symptoms, which should be attributed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span>
sympathies, and among which appears particularly the
kind of shiver in of which I have spoken.</p>

<p>In the beginning of digestion a kind of sympathetic
cold is also referred to the skin, which is most often as
warm as usual; it is an action exerted by the stomach
upon the cutaneous sensibility, an action from which
arises a particular sensation, different no doubt from that
which the same viscus, when disordered, produces in the
head, occasioning head-ache, but which is owing however
to the same principle.</p>

<p>The heat is very often sympathetic in the cutaneous
organ, less however, as I have observed, than in the mucous
system. We know the flushes of heat that so often
extend over the skin in an irregular manner, in different
fevers, and which are not attended with a greater disengagement
of caloric.</p>

<p>Our modern philosophers will not perhaps be able to
understand, how it is that whilst in the greatest number
of cases, the application of a degree of caloric superior or
inferior to that of our temperature, is necessary to produce
heat or cold, this sensation can arise in a part though
it may not have experienced an increase or diminution
of this principle. But in the greatest number of cases
has not pain a material cause? And yet all sympathies
produce it without this cause. The vulgar, who stop at
the diversity of the modifications of feeling, believe that
an insulated principle presides over each. Let us disregard
all these modifications, in order to see but a single
principle in the irregularities as in the regular course of
sensibility. That this property, sympathetically altered,
gives us the sensation of heat or cold as in the skin, of
pulling as in the nerves, of lassitude as in the muscles
in the beginning of a disease, &amp;c.; these are but varieties
of a single cause, one, of which we are ignorant, but
which evidently exists. In general, the sympathies of
animal sensibility put into action in each system the sen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span>sation
which is usual there. The sympathy which, acting
upon the skin, creates there a sensation of heat or of
cold, would have produced that of lassitude if it had acted
upon a muscle.</p>

<p>In order to form an exact idea of heat and cold considered
as sensations, let us recollect that they may arise
from different causes. 1st. From the increase or diminution
of the caloric of the atmosphere. 2d. From the disengagement
or the want of disengagement of this fluid in a
part of the economy, as in a phlegmon or after the ligature
of an artery of a limb. 3d. Sometimes without
previous inflammation more caloric is disengaged in the
whole body; there is a general increase of temperature;
we then feel an internal and external heat; or caloric is
disengaged locally in a part of the skin, and the patient
feels a heat there as he does who applies his hand upon
this place. 4th. Finally, there are sympathies of heat and
cold. Some other parts, besides the mucous surfaces and
the skin, feel these sympathies; we know the sensation
of coldness that is felt to arise from the abdomen to the
thorax, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The organic properties of the skin are also frequently
put into action by sympathies. The sweat on the skin is
suppressed in a moment, if a cold body is taken into the
stomach. The entrance of teas into this viscus, and an
increased cutaneous exhalation, are two phenomena that
take place almost at the same instant; so that we cannot
refer the second to the absorption of the drink, then to
its passage into the black blood through the lungs, and
afterwards into the red blood. The production of sweat
is then here analogous to its suppression in the preceding
case; it resembles that of fear, and that of phthisis in
which the lungs being affected act upon the skin. Shall
I speak of the innumerable varieties of this organ in diseases,
of its dryness, its moisture, its copious sweats, &amp;c.
phenomena for the most part sympathetic, and which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span>
arise from the relations which connect this sound organ
with the diseased parts? I have pointed out those which
exist between it and the mucous surfaces. The membrane
of the stomach is the one with which it especially sympathizes.
The digestive phenomena are a proof of this.
It would be necessary to treat of all diseases in order to
speak of the sympathetic influences exerted upon the skin.
These influences are often chronic. How in many organic
diseases, do different tumours form upon the skin?
Precisely as petechiÃ¦, miliary eruptions, &amp;c. are produced
in acute fevers; the difference is only in the duration of
the sympathetic phenomena.</p>

<p>Animal and sensible organic contractility cannot be
evidently put into action in the passive sympathies of the
skin, since it is not endowed with these properties.</p>


<h5><i>Active Sympathies.</i></h5>

<p>The four classes of cutaneous affections of which we
have spoken, occasion many sympathetic phenomena, the
following are some of them.</p>

<p>1st. Whenever the papillÃ¦ are strongly excited, as in
the tickling of very sensitive people, various organs feel
it sympathetically; sometimes it is the heart; hence the
syncopes that then take place; sometimes it is the stomach;
thus I knew two persons who could be made to vomit by
tickling them; sometimes it is the brain, as when in very
irritable people, tickling is carried so far as to produce
convulsions, which is not very rare in nervous women.
Who is ignorant of the influence which the organs of
generation receive from the skin, when stimulated in different
parts?</p>

<p>Physicians are often astonished at the extraordinary
effects which some mountebanks produce in the economy,
who know how to profit by their knowledge of the cutaneous
sympathies produced by tickling. But why should
we be more astonished at these phenomena, than at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span>
vomitings produced by an affection of the womb, at the
diseases of the liver arising from an injury of the brain,
or at hemicrania the seat of which is in the gastric viscera?
The only difference is that we can in the first instance,
produce to a certain extent those sympathetic phenomena,
which we only observe in the other. Why do
we not oftener make use in medicine of the influence
which the skin when tickled exerts upon the other organs?
In hemiplegia, in adynamic, ataxic fevers, &amp;c. who knows
if the excitement of the sole of the foot, which is so sensible,
as every one knows, if that of the hypochondrium,
which is not less so in some people, &amp;c. would not be
better, if repeated ten or twenty times a day, than the
application of a blister, the irritation of which soon passes
off? Besides you would never obtain by a blister, rubefacients,
&amp;c. means which act as much and more upon
the organic than the animal sensibility, an effect as striking,
an affection as general in the sensitive system, as by
the tickling of certain parts, a means, which acting only
upon this last species of sensibility, produces phenomena
exclusively nervous; whilst the exhalant system and the
capillary with red blood are especially affected by the
others. Certainly there are cases in which one of these
means is preferable to the other. I propose to ascertain
these cases.</p>

<p>We have not yet sufficiently analyzed the different
kinds of excitement in diseases; we have not endeavoured
to profit enough by what observation has taught us,
upon the sympathies we can produce at will. Might we
not however say, that nature has established certain relations
between very remote organs, that we may be able
to make use of these relations in our means of cure?
The charlatan, who employs external tickling for certain
nervous affections, is often more rational, without knowing
it, than the physician with all his pharmaceutical
means.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span></p>

<p>2d. Whenever the cutaneous exhalants or the external
capillary system from which they arise, are affected in
any manner, many other parts feel it, and this is a second
order of the active sympathies of the skin. Here are referred
a great number of phenomena, of which the following
are a part.</p>

<p>A bath which acts upon the skin during digestion,
affects sympathetically the stomach, and disturbs this
function. When this viscus is agitated by spasmodic
motions, oftentimes the influence which it receives from
it suddenly calms it, and brings it to its ordinary state.
Not long since in my evening visit at the HÃ´tel Dieu, I
saw a woman who was vomiting continually from a sudden
suppression of her catamenia. I directed sedatives
which were useless. The next evening she was in the
same state; I had her put into a bath; every thing was
calmed the moment she came out of it, and yet the catamenia
did not return. Few organs are more dependant
on the skin than the stomach.</p>

<p>The action of cold upon the cutaneous organ produces
many sympathetic effects, especially when this action
takes place while we are sweating. The term repercussion
of transpiration is not proper to express what then
takes place; it gives a very inaccurate idea. Let us suppose
that a pleurisy arises from cold suddenly applied,
the following is what happens; the organic sensibility of
the skin being immediately altered, that of the pleura is
sympathetically altered. By it the exhalants become in
relation with the blood; they admit it instead of the
serum which they before received, and inflammation supervenes.
Thus this phenomenon is the same as that in
which the application of a cold body upon the skin suddenly
arrests uterine, nasal hemorrhage, &amp;c. &amp;c.; the result
only differs. Now in this last case, no one ever supposed
that there was a repercussion of fluid. The suppression
of the transpiration is a thing purely accessory<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span>
and foreign to the internal inflammation which takes
place. When the skin sweats in summer, the vital forces
are more raised by the caloric which penetrates it; in
this state, it is more capable of acting sympathetically
upon the forces of the other systems. Hence why all
strong stimulants that act upon it are more to be feared
then. It is so true that it is not the suppression of the
sweat which is dangerous, but the alteration of the vital
forces of the skin which sweats, that many kinds, as the
sweat of phthisis, are not so injurious when they cease
for a time; they are checked even with much more difficulty,
because they are not produced by a cause acting
immediately upon the skin. Now if there was a repercussion
of the transpiration, every species of sweat that
was suppressed would be injurious. We never hear of a
peripneumony arising from a suppression of sweat produced
by fear, rheumatism, &amp;c. There would be then also
a repercussion of mucous matter, when a pleurisy arises
from swallowing a glass of cold water. Men judge only
by that which is striking. The suppression of the sweat is
an effect like inflammation of the pleura, but it is not the
cause of it. If there was no sweat the instant the cold
was applied to the skin, inflammation would nevertheless
come on. In wounds of the head, with abscesses of
the liver, &amp;c. there is no repercussion of fluids.</p>

<p>The trembling of which the voluntary muscles become
the seat, the debility of the pulse which the weakness of
the action of the heart produces, &amp;c. are phenomena which
the influence of the skin affected by cold alone causes.
In fact, only this organ, the commencement of the mucous
surfaces and all of that of the bronchia, are made
cold by the external air; all the others remain at their
usual temperature.</p>

<p>We know the innumerable phenomena which arise from
the disappearance of herpes, the itch, &amp;c. imprudently
produced; in all these cases it does not appear that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span>
morbific matter is carried to the other organs, though I
do not pretend that this never happens. It is the vital
forces of these which are raised and which then occasion
different accidents; now as these forces vary in each system,
these accidents will be essentially different; thus the
same morbific cause disappearing from the skin, will produce
vomiting if thrown upon the stomach, in which the
sensible organic contractility predominates; pains, if it
goes to the nerves which are especially characterized by
animal sensibility; derangements of sight, hearing and
smell, if it affects the respective viscera of these senses;
hemorrhage, catarrhs, phthisis, tubercular inflammation,
&amp;c. if it attacks the mucous surfaces, the lungs, the serous
membranes, &amp;c. in which the organic sensibility is much
raised. Now, if the same morbific matter carried upon
these different organs, produced these accidents, they
ought to be uniform. Do not their varieties, and especially
the constant analogy which they have with the predominant
vital forces of the organs in which they appear,
prove, that they depend upon the cause which I have
pointed out?</p>

<p>We know that the serous surfaces and the cellular texture
on the one part, and the skin on the other, are often
in opposition in diseases. There is no sweat when dropsies
are formed; the dryness of the skin is often even
more remarkable than the small quantity of urine, &amp;c.</p>

<p>3d. When the cellular texture contained in the dermoid
spaces is inflamed, as in phlegmonous inflammation, in
biles, in some malignant pustules, &amp;c. there comes on
many sympathies which can be referred to those of the
general cellular system, which have been already noticed.</p>

<p>4th. The affections of the chorion itself, all marked
with a chronic character, on account of the kind of
vitality and structure of this portion of the skin, occasion
also sympathies which have the same chronic character,
but of which we know but little.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span></p>

<p>The organic contractility cannot be put sympathetically
in action in the skin, as it does not exist there.</p>


<h5><i>Characters of the Vital Properties. First Character.
The Cutaneous Life varies in each organ.</i></h5>

<p>Though we have spoken in general of the vital properties
of the skin, they are far from being uniform or at the
same degree in all the regions.</p>

<p>1st. There is no doubt that the animal sensibility of the
soles of the feet and the palms of the hands is greater
than that of the other parts. Many persons are so sensible
in the hypochondriac region, that the least tickling
there produces convulsions. The anterior and lateral part
of the trunk is always more sensible than the region of
the back.</p>

<p>2d. The organic properties do not vary less. The extreme
susceptibility of the face to receive the blood, is a
proof of it, as I have said. It is generally known that
some parts are more proper than others for the application
of blisters. Observe on this subject that the places
where the animal sensibility predominates, are not the
same as those in which the organic is in the greatest proportion.
The soles of the feet and the palms of the hands
hold the first rank in relation to one, and the face in relation
to the other.</p>

<p>In diseases we also see these varieties. Who does not
know that some particular parts of the skin are especially
the seat of some particular cutaneous affections, and that
when these affections are general, they always predominate
in certain places. We ought not to be astonished at
these varieties, since we have seen that the dermoid texture
is infinitely variable as it respects its papillÃ¦, its reticular
body, its chorion, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span></p>


<h5><i>Second Character. Intermission in one relation;
continuity in another.</i></h5>

<p>The life of the cutaneous system is essentially intermittent
in relation to animal sensibility. All the senses
exhibit this phenomenon. Thus when the eye has for a
long time gazed upon objects, the ear heard sounds, the
nose received odours, and the mouth tastes, these different
organs become unfit to receive new sensations;
they become fatigued, and require rest to regain their
forces. It is the same with regard to feeling and the
touch; wearied by the impression of surrounding bodies,
the skin requires an intermission of action to regain excitability
adapted to new impressions. We know that a
short time before sleep, external bodies produce but an
obscure sensation upon it, and that their contact has no
effect in this state, in which animals seem to lose half of
their existence. The more powerfully the cutaneous
sensibility has been excited, the more profound is sleep;
hence why all painful exercises, great frictions, &amp;c. are
always followed by a deep sleep. Yet this sense can
sometimes exert itself, while the others sleep; pinch the
leg of a man asleep; he draws it away without waking,
and has afterwards no remembrance of the sensation.
Thus somnambulists often hear sounds, even eat, &amp;c.;
for, as I have said elsewhere, sleep may affect but a very
limited part of animal life, as it may the whole.</p>

<p>Under the relation of organic sensibility, the life of the
cutaneous system is essentially continuous. Thus the
functions over which this property presides have a character
opposite to the preceding. The insensible transpiration
takes place continually, though there may be some
periods in which it is more active than in others. The
oily fluid is incessantly carried away and renewed; we
might even say sometimes that it is when the animal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span>
sensibility is interrupted, that the organic is in the greatest
exercise.</p>

<p>It is especially in diseases that they have made this
observation, which is besides generally applicable to organic
life. All this life is as active and even more so
during the night than during the day. Most of the diseases
that attack the functions which belong to it, are
marked by an increase of activity during the night. All
fevers which particularly affect the circulation have their
exacerbation towards night. In diseases of the heart, the
patients are more oppressed at this period, &amp;c. In phthisis
which affects respiration, it is in the night especially that
there is hectic fever, sweats, &amp;c. Pneumonia and pleurisy,
exhibit frequent exacerbations towards night. In
glandular diseases, either acute or chronic we make the
same observation. It would be necessary to refer to
almost all the affections which alter especially an organic
function, in order to omit nothing upon this point. On
the contrary, observe hemiplegia, epilepsy, convulsions,
various paralysies of the different organs of sense, most
mental alienations, apoplexy and other affections which
exert their influence more particularly upon animal life,
they have not, so often at least, their exacerbations towards
evening and during the night, no doubt because in
the natural state, this life is in the habit of becoming
drowsy and not of being raised like the other which seems
to imprint this character upon its alterations. Other
causes no doubt have an influence upon this phenomenon;
but I believe this to be a real one.</p>


<h5><i>Third Character. Influence of the Sexes.</i></h5>

<p>The sex has an influence upon the cutaneous life. In
general the animal portion of this life is more raised in
women, in whom every thing that belongs to the sensations
is proportionally more marked than in man, who predominates
by the power of his locomotive muscles. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span>
effects of tickling are infinitely more powerful in females.
All the arts which require nicety and delicacy of touch are
advantageously cultivated by women. The peculiar texture
of the chorion, a texture generally more delicate, has
no doubt an influence upon this phenomenon. As to the
organic portion of the cutaneous life, the difference is
not very great. Man appears to be superior in this respect;
he generally sweats more; his skin is more unctuous,
which proves a greater secretion.</p>


<h5><i>Fourth Character. Influence of Temperament.</i></h5>

<p>The temperament peculiar to each individual is not a
less real cause of differences in the skin. We know that
the colour, roughness and pliability of this organ vary
according as individuals are sanguineous, phlegmatic, &amp;c.
that these external attributes are even a character of the
temperaments. Varieties of structure no doubt coincide
with these. Is it then astonishing that the animal sensibility
differs so much, that the touch itself should be delicate
in some and dull in others, that some should be very
ticklish, whilst others are not so at all, &amp;c.? Ought we
to be astonished if the organic sensibility, which is very
variable, should determine, according to the individuals,
many varieties in the phenomena over which it presides;
if in some, it allows much blood to go to the face, and
if it repels this fluid in others who are always pale; if
some men sweat much, whilst others have the skin almost
always dry; if the cutaneous oil varies in quantity; if
there are some skins much disposed to eruptions, either
acute or chronic, to pimples of different natures, and if
others are almost always free from them, even when the
individuals expose themselves to the contagion of these
diseases; if superficial wounds, of the same extent and
made by the same instrument, are sometimes quicker and
sometimes slower in healing; if the cure of cutaneous
diseases is also very variable in its periods, &amp;c. &amp;c.?</p>

<h3>ARTICLE FOURTH.<br />

<small>DEVELOPMENT OF THE DERMOID SYSTEM.</small></h3>


<h4>I. <i>State of this System in the FÅ“tus.</i></h4>

<p>In the first periods after conception, the skin is but
a kind of glutinous covering, which seems to be gradually
condensed, forms a transparent envelope, through which
we see in part the subjacent organs, the vessels especially,
and which is torn by the least jar. This state continues
for a month and a half or two months. The consistence
constantly increasing, soon gives to the skin an appearance
more nearly like that which it has in infants after
birth. Its delicacy is extreme at this period. It has not
one quarter the thickness of that of the adult. The moment
in which it begins to lose its mucous state appears
to be that in which the fibres of the chorion are formed.
Until then the cellular texture and the vessels especially
composed it, and as the first is abundantly filled with
juices during the early periods, it is not astonishing that it
should then give way under the least pressure. But when
the fibres are formed, the cellular texture diminishes on
the one hand, and is concentrated in the spaces that are
developed, and on the other the dermoid fibres, more dense
than its layers, increase the resistance.</p>

<p>We do not see upon the external surface of the skin of
the fÅ“tus most of the wrinkles of which we have spoken
above. Those of the face in particular are not seen; the
kind of immobility, in which the facial muscles are, is
evidently the reason of it. The forehead, the eyelids,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span>
the edges of the lips, &amp;c. are smooth. Besides, the
abundance of fat which then distends the integuments of
the cheeks, prevents every species of fold there. As the
hands and the feet are found in part bent at their articulations,
by the attitude of the fÅ“tus, different wrinkles are
already formed about these articulations, principally on
the hand, where however they appear less in proportion
than afterwards. The curved, papillary lines are not very
evident on the foot and the hand, even when the epidermis
is removed.</p>

<p>The internal surface of the skin is remarkable for the
slight adhesion of the subjacent cellular texture, the cells
of which filled with fatty particles are removed with great
ease, by scraping this surface with the edge of a knife.
We see then there the spaces already well formed, and as
distinct in proportion as afterwards. By pursuing their
dissection from within outwards, we insensibly lose sight
of them towards the external surface where the skin is
condensed.</p>

<p>More blood enters the skin of the fÅ“tus, than at any
other period of life. It is easy to observe this in small
animals taken alive from the womb of their mother; for
in the fÅ“tuses that are dead at birth, or born prematurely,
the cause which destroys life, increasing or diminishing
in the last moments the quantity of cutaneous blood, prevents
us from drawing any conclusion as to the ordinary
state by an inspection of them. The nerves are, as in all
the other parts, more evident; but the papillÃ¦, though sensible,
as I have said, have not a proportionable increase.</p>

<p>The animal sensibility is not in exercise in the skin of
the fÅ“tus, or at least it is very obscure there. This is
owing to the absence of the causes of excitement. These
are the surrounding heat, the waters of the amnios and
the parietes of the womb, which can furnish materials for
sensations; but as these causes are always uniform, and
have no varieties, the fÅ“tus can have but a very feeble<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span>
perception, because acuteness of sensation requires change
of stimuli. We know that heat long continued at the
same degree becomes insensible, that a long continuance
in a bath takes away almost entirely the sensation of the
water, because habit is every thing as it respects sensation;
nothing but what is new affects us powerfully.</p>

<p>Is the organic sensibility of the skin in activity in the
fÅ“tus? does it preside over the alternate exhalation and
absorption of the waters of the amnios? This is not the
common opinion, it is not even a probable one; but this
question is far from being settled in so precise a manner
as many other points of physiology.</p>

<p>Besides, it cannot be doubted that there is a copious
secretion of an unctuous and viscid fluid, which covers
the whole body of the fÅ“tus, but which is more abundant
in some places than others, as behind the ears, in the
groin, the axilla, &amp;c. either because it is secreted there
in greater quantity, or accumulated on account of the
arrangement of the parts. Accoucheurs have it wiped off
after birth, and the females of animals remove it by the
repeated application of their tongues to the surface of the
body. This fluid appears to be to the skin of the fÅ“tus
what the oily fluid is to that of the adult; it defends this
organ from the impression of the waters of the amnios.
If the sebaceous glands exist, it would appear that they
furnish it, for it is certainly from a different source from
the sweat. When care has not been taken to remove this
covering, it irritates the skin, and may produce excoriations,
and a species of erysipelas. The air cannot remove
it by solution. Nothing similar oozes from the skin of
the infant after birth. Is it because the black blood alone
is capable of furnishing the materials of this substance?</p>


<h4>II. <i>State of the Dermoid System during growth.</i></h4>

<p>At the moment of birth the dermis experiences a sudden
revolution. Hitherto entered only by black blood,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">338</span>
it is at the time the fÅ“tus is born, more or less coloured
by it. Some fÅ“tuses come wholly livid, others are paler;
there is a remarkable variety in this respect. But all,
shortly after they have respired, become more or less decidedly
red. It is owing to the arterial blood which is
formed and succeeds the venous blood that circulated in
the cutaneous arteries. In this respect the state of the
skin is in general an index of what goes on in the lungs.
If an infant remains a long time of a violet colour, he
either does not breathe or breathes with difficulty. The
extremities of the hands and the feet in general become
red the last. They are those in which the lividity consequently
continues the longest, when this lividity is very
evident. The blood which goes to the cutaneous organ,
enters it in general in a very uniform manner; the cheeks
do not appear to receive more of it in proportion. The
sudden excitement it brings to the organ, raises its vital
forces and renders it more fit to receive the impressions,
which are new to it, of the surrounding bodies.</p>

<p>Observe in fact that a thousand different agents, the
surrounding temperature, the air, dress, the fluid in which
the fÅ“tus is washed, the tongues of those quadrupeds who
lick their young, carry to the skin an excitement which
is so much the more felt by the fÅ“tus, as it is not accustomed
to it, and as there is an essential difference between
these stimuli, and those to which it had been previously
subjected. It is then that the remarkable sympathy
which connects the skin with all the other organs,
becomes especially necessary. Every thing within soon
perceives the new excitements that are applied without.
It is these excitements, those of the mucous surfaces at
their origin and those of the whole of the bronchia, which
especially bring into action many organs hitherto inactive.
There happens then, what is observed in syncope, in which
respiration, circulation, the cerebral action and many functions
suspended by the affection, are suddenly roused up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span>
by external friction, by the irritation of the pituitary
membrane, &amp;c. The phenomena are different, but the
principles from which they are derived in both cases are
the same.</p>

<p>Then the organic sensibility is also raised. Transpiration
is established. The skin begins to be an emunctory
of different substances, which it did not before throw
out; it becomes also capable of absorbing different principles
applied to its surface. The skin of the fÅ“tus is
hardly ever the seat of any kind of eruptions; then pimples
of different kinds frequently appear.</p>

<p>All the parts of the cutaneous organ do not however
appear to be raised to the same degree of organic sensibility.
For a long time after birth the skin of the cranium
appears to be the centre of a more active life; it becomes
the frequent seat of many eruptions, all of which
denote an excess of the vital forces. The different kinds
of scurf with which it is covered do not appear elsewhere.
In this respect, the skin of the cranium follows, like the
bones of this part and the cerebral membranes, the early
development of the brain, which, on this account is the
seat of diseases in infancy more than at any other age.</p>

<p>The skin of the face seems to be sometimes in less
activity. In the first months after birth, it has not that
bright colour which it will afterwards have upon the
cheeks, and which does not commence until the development
of the sinuses and dentition bring to this part more
vital activity for the nutritive work. It is also towards
this period that the eruptions of which this part of the
cutaneous system is especially the seat, like those of the
small-pox, measles, &amp;c. begin to take place.</p>

<p>For a long time after birth the skin still preserves a
remarkable degree of softness; a very great quantity of
gelatine enters it; this substance is obtained from it with
great ease by ebullition, which, continued for some time,
finally melts this organ entirely. The fibrous part noticed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span>
by Seguin, is in very small quantity. I think it is this
predominance of the gelatinous portion of the skin, which
renders that of young animals easy of digestion. We
know that in calvesâ€™ heads, roasted lamb, and small sucking
pigs, prepared for our tables, it presents an aliment
which the digestive juices alter with the greatest ease;
whilst that of animals of mature age and especially old
ones, cannot be digested by them. The carnivorous
species tear their prey, feed upon its internal organs, the
muscles especially, and leave the skin. Now what is it
that makes the skin of young animals differ from that of
old ones? It is because the gelatinous substance predominates
over the fibrous in the first, and the fibrous predominates
in the second.</p>

<p>The skin of children is gradually thickened; but it is
not until the thirtieth year that it acquires the thickness
that it is always to have afterwards. Till then the different
ages are marked in this respect by different degrees.
Take a portion of skin at birth, at two, six, ten, fifteen,
twenty years, &amp;c. you will see these differences in a remarkable
manner. The more its thickness increases the
more compact it becomes; it is because the fibrous substance
tends constantly to predominate over the gelatinous.</p>

<p>As we advance in age, the adhesion of the internal surface
of the dermis with the subjacent cellular texture becomes
much greater. It is more difficult to detach one
from the other. On the external surface the wrinkles of
the face are gradually formed. Smiles and tears agitate
the face of the infant the most. One is the expression of
the happiness, the other of the uneasiness which all its
passions produce in its mind. Now the wrinkles which
weeping occasions on the eyelids are marked in rather a
more permanent manner, either because weeping is more
frequent than smiling, or because continual winking adds to
the motion which weeping produces, or because less fat is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span>
found in this place. As smiling is on the one hand more
rare, and on the other much fat puffs out the cheeks of
the infant, the perpendicular wrinkles formed by the
muscles of the face, which in this motion separate transversely
the features from within outwards, are much
slower in forming. Besides, the nursing of the infant,
which requires the contraction of its face from without
inwards, opposes their formation. The wrinkles of the
forehead are always very slow in forming, because the
motions which contract the eyebrow, and those which
wrinkle the forehead, are rare in the infant, who has
hardly any of those dark passions which these motions
serve to depict.</p>

<p>The growth of the dermoid system has not remarkable
revolutions like that of most of the others; it goes on in
an uniform manner. At the period of the growth of the
hairs, it does not change, because this growth is absolutely
foreign to it, these productions only passing through
it. At puberty it increases in energy like all the other systems.
Until then sweats had not been very copious; for,
other things being equal, we may say that children sweat
less in general than adults, and that the residue of their
nutrition passes rather by the urine, which is probably the
reason why they are so remarkably disposed to calculi.
Beyond the twentieth year we begin to sweat more, and
until old age, especially in summer, the fluids appear to
go out in this way.</p>


<h4>III. <i>State of the Dermoid System after Growth.</i></h4>

<p>After growth, the skin continues for a long time to
have great activity; the excess of life which animates it,
renders it capable of influencing with ease the other organs
if it be but a little excited. Hence the disposition to
pneumonia, pleurisy, &amp;c. from the action of cold on the
skin in sweat, a state in which it is more disposed to exert
an injurious influence upon the internal organs, because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span>
its forces are more excited. As to the different affections
which result from this influence, they depend upon the
internal organs upon which it is directed; so that the
same sympathetic irradiations going from the skin, will
produce sometimes an affection of the abdomen, sometimes
a disease of the thorax, according to the age in
which the abdominal or pectoral organs, predominating
by their vitality, are more disposed to answer to the influence
directed in general upon the whole economy.</p>

<p>The skin becomes more and more firm and resisting
as we advance in age, as the fibrous substance is constantly
tending to a predominance over the gelatinous. Less
blood seems to be carried to it. It becomes less and less
disposed to eruptions, so common in youth and infancy,
&amp;c. I will not speak of its other differences; for all that
we have said of it in the preceding articles relates especially
to the adult age.</p>

<p>I will only observe that if, during the greatest part of
life, the skin be so fruitful a source of diseases, and the
various alterations it experiences produce so frequent disorders
in the internal organs, it is only owing to the
varied causes of excitement to which it is every instant
subjected. If the glands, the serous surfaces, &amp;c. have
an influence less frequently upon the other organs, it is
because being deeply situated, and almost always in contact
with the same excitants, they are not subject to so
many revolutions in their vital forces. The secreted fluids
and those exhaled in the serous and synovial systems are
not, for the same reason, so much subject to those considerable
increases, and those sudden suppressions which
so frequently happen to the sweat.</p>

<p>Observe that society has also multiplied to a great extent
the injurious excitements to which the skin is subjected.
These excitements consist especially in the rapid
passage from heat to cold, which makes the latter act
very powerfully upon the cutaneous sensibility, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">343</span>
like that of all the other systems, answers so much the
more to excitements made upon it, as they are different
from those, whose action they had previously experienced.
In the natural state, there is only the succession of the
seasons; nature knows how to connect insensibly heat
with cold, and to make the transition but rarely abrupt.
But in society, the different garments, the artificial degrees
of temperature of our apartments, degrees differing
at first from that of the atmosphere, then varying greatly
from each other, so that the same man who in winter enters
thirty apartments, is often subjected to thirty different
temperatures; the hard labour in which most men are engaged,
and which makes them sweat copiously, every
thing incessantly presents numerous causes which make
the vital forces of the dermoid system vary rapidly. Thus
the bronchial mucous surface is constantly in contact in
cities, with a thousand excitements that are continually
renewed, and with which the air is not charged in a
natural state. Thus the alimentary substances, continually
varying in their composition, temperature, &amp;c. change
the excitement of the gastric mucous surface, and are the
source of many affections, from which most animals are
exempt by the uniformity of their food.</p>

<p>If the skin and the mucous surfaces were always kept
at the same degree of excitement by the constant uniformity
of the stimuli, they would certainly be a much less
fruitful source of diseases, as is clearly proved by the
fÅ“tus, which is hardly ever sick, because all the external
causes which act upon its mucous and cutaneous sensibility,
as the heat, the waters of the amnios and the parietes
of the womb, do not vary until birth. At this period,
animals brought into a new medium, find many more
varieties in the stimuli which act upon them, even in a
natural state and far from society; thus their diseases are
naturally much more frequent after than before birth. In
society, in which man has increased four, six and even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span>
ten times the number of the stimuli which affect the surfaces
destined to be in contact with the external bodies, is
it astonishing that the diseases should be so disproportioned
to those of animals?</p>


<h4>IV. <i>State of the Dermoid System in Old Age.</i></h4>

<p>Towards the decline of life, the dermoid system becomes
more and more firm and compact; it is softened
with great difficulty by ebullition. The gelatine, which
it yields, is less abundant and more hard and consistent.
I think it would not be fit to make any kind of glue,
even the strongest, unless mixed with that of adult animals.
Its yellowish tinge becomes very deep. When it
is cooled, it requires a much stronger and more durable
fire to melt it; the fibrous portion of the dermis which
does not melt or at least resists for a long time, is infinitely
greater in proportion. It is like the bones in
which the gelatinous portion is in an inverse ratio, and
the earthy portion in a direct ratio to the age.</p>

<p>The dermoid texture becomes then like all the others,
dense and stiff; it is not proper for our food, the teeth
cannot tear it. Prepared with tannin, it is more resisting
and less pliable, and cannot on that account serve for the
same purposes as that taken from young animals. Every
one knows the difference of the leather of calves and oxen,
especially when the latter are old. This difference is
owing first to the thickness, which being much greater in
the second than the first, does not allow it to be so easily
bent in different directions; and then to the nature of the
texture itself. Cut in two horizontally a piece of the
leather of an ox; each half will be as thin as a piece of
calves skin, and yet it will be less pliable. I do not estimate
here the varieties which may depend on the greater
or less quantity of tannin that may be combined with it;
I suppose the proportions to be all equal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span></p>

<p>Submitted to desiccation, the human dermoid texture
becomes much more stiff in old age than in the preceding
ones. Maceration softens it with more difficulty. The
hair of a child falls out much sooner by it than that of
an old person; thus it requires longer to clean the skins
of old animals than those of young ones; tanners know
this very well. I would remark upon this subject, that
the skins of animals, having more hairs pass through them,
exhibit in comparison with that of man, an innumerable
quantity of little pores on their external surface; which
favours in them on this surface the action of tannin, which
insinuating itself into the dermoid spaces and filling them
completely with a new substance formed by the combination
of tannin with gelatine, occupies entirely the texture
of the spaces. The previous maceration to which the
skin has been exposed, favours not only the removal of
the hairs, but facilitates also to a great degree the entrance
of the tannin, by separating the fibres of the spaces,
by making them larger, and increasing the size of the external
pores.</p>

<p>The more we advance in age, the less is the quantity of
blood that penetrates the skin. The redness of the cheeks
disappears in old people. We no longer see then the
rosy complexion of the young man and even of the adult,
and which arose from the vessels winding through the
cellular texture of the spaces of the chorion.</p>

<p>The continual pressure of external objects increases
then remarkably the adhesion of the subjacent cellular
texture to the dermis. They are separated from each other
with great difficulty by carrying the edge of a scalpel
over the internal face of the chorion; a circumstance
which is owing also to this, that the cellular texture having
become more dense, is less easily torn; for this tearing
is then necessary, considering the continuity of the
sub-dermoid layer with that which enters the spaces.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">346</span>
The exterior of the skin is uneven and rough. All the
wrinkles of which we have spoken become infinitely more
evident; many belong exclusively to this age.</p>

<p>The vital forces of the dermoid system are more weakened
in old age than those of most of the others, because
it is more excited during life by external bodies. Most
of these bodies then make no impression upon it. The
habit of feeling has blunted the animal sensibility. The
touch is exercised but rarely; for, as I have observed,
this sense requires to put it in action, the previous exercise
of the will. We touch, because we have previously
seen, heard, tasted, &amp;c. in order to correct or confirm our
other sensations; now the old man, to whom every thing
around is known, to whom nothing is new, is induced
to touch nothing. Compare in this respect the two extreme
ages of life. The infant, to whom every thing that
strikes his eyes, his ears, his nostrils, &amp;c. is unknown,
who finds in every thing that surrounds him new objects
of sensation, wishes to touch and lay hold of every thing.
Its little hands are in continual agitation. To touch is a
pleasure to him, for every new object of sensation is
agreeable. If in his last years, man was transported into
the midst of objects that never before struck his senses,
he would oftener exercise his touch; but none of those
things excite him among which he has always lived.
Hence why old age is not the age of enjoyments. In
fact all our pleasures are almost relative; we have but
little that is absolute; now as habit blunts all the relative
pleasures, which cease because they have existed, the
more the sensations are accumulated by time, the less
there are of new ones left to be experienced, and the more
are the sources of happiness dried up. For a contrary
reason, the happiest age is infancy, because it has before
it the whole field of sensations to go over. Man at every
step of his career leaves behind him a cause of his enjoyments.
When arrived at the end he finds only indif<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">347</span>ference,
a state very suitable to his situation, since it
diminishes the distance that separates life from death.</p>

<p>The organic sensibility of the skin is not less blunted
in old age, than its animal sensibility; hence the following
phenomena; 1st, contagious miasmata are absorbed
with difficulty at this age; almost all pass over the cutaneous
surface with impunity. 2d. The exhalation of
sweat is uniformly less; it is hardly ever subject to those
great increases, that are seen in the adult. 3d. The oily
fluid is also furnished in much less quantity; hence the
constant dryness of the exterior of the skin, the cracking
of the epidermis in some cases, &amp;c. 4th. All the diseases
which suppose an increase of this organic sensibility are
much more rare. Erysipelas and the different kinds of
eruptions are a proof of it. When these affections take
place, they have a character of remarkable slowness. 5th.
The skin resists external cold much less; it loses easily
the caloric of the body, which always tends to escape in
order to be in equilibrium with that of the surrounding
medium; thus old people are always fond of heat. 6th.
I am well persuaded that the skin would resist also less,
at this age, a degree of temperature greater than that of
the body, and as it permits the internal caloric to be easily
lost in a colder medium, it would allow the external to
penetrate in a warmer one. It would be very curious to
repeat, on the two extreme ages of life, the experiments
of the English physicians.</p>

<h2 id="EPIDERMOID_SYSTEM">EPIDERMOID SYSTEM.</h2>


<p>If we examine attentively, it is easy to perceive the
immense difference there is between the preceding system
and this, which physiologists have considered as one of
its dependancies. Organization, properties, composition,
functions, growth, &amp;c. every thing differs in the two. By
explaining these, the line of demarcation that separates
them will be perceived.</p>

<p>I rank in this system, 1st, the external epidermis; 2d,
that which is spread upon the mucous system, or at least
upon one of its parts; 3d, the nails. Though these last
differ very much from the epidermis in their external
appearance, yet they resemble it in so many respects,
that it is difficult not to place them in the same system.
In fact the nails serve as an epidermis for the skin which
is subjacent to them; they are continued with that of the
fingers in an evident manner, are detached and regenerated
during life with the same phenomena. The composition
appears to be very analogous. The kind of excrescences
is the same. After death, the nails are detached
by the same means as the epidermis, and then
make, as it were, a part of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span></p>


<hr class="chap" />

<h3>ARTICLE FIRST.<br />

<small>OF THE EXTERNAL EPIDERMIS.</small></h3>

<p>The external epidermis is a transparent membrane,
more or less thick, according to the regions in which it
is examined, covering everywhere the skin, and receiving
immediately the excitement of external bodies which
would act too powerfully upon this.</p>


<h4>I. <i>Forms, Relations with the Dermis, &amp;c.</i></h4>

<p>We see upon the epidermis the same wrinkles as upon
the skin, because being exactly contiguous, both wrinkle
at the same time. Different pores open on its surface
after having passed through it. Some transmit the hairs;
these are the most apparent; others give passage to the
exhalants. We do not see these in the natural state, because
their course is oblique, and they open between two
small layers, which, being in contact with each other
when we do not sweat, conceal their termination. But
if, the skin being very dry, we suddenly sweat, as after
drinking tea, then the little drops which escape from the
whole cutaneous surface, not having had time to run
together, but remaining separate, we see, by the places
where they are, the orifice of the exhalants. Besides, if
we examine against the light a considerable portion of
epidermis, its transparency allows us to see many small
pores separated from each other by interstices, and which
pass through it in an oblique direction. It is only in the
soles of the feet and the palms of the hands that we cannot
make this observation, which is owing to the thickness
in those parts. It is impossible to distinguish in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">351</span>
these pores the absorbent orifices from those of the exhalants,
even when mercury enters the first by friction.</p>

<p>The internal surface of the epidermis adheres very
closely to the skin. The means of union are at first the
exhalants, the absorbents and the hairs, which in passing
through the first, adhere to it more or less, and thus fix
it to the second, from which they arise. By separating
the epidermis by maceration, which is the most proper
means, we see on its internal surface many small
elongations of greater or less length, and which, when
examined attentively, appear to be nothing but the broken
extremities of exhalants and absorbents. In fact these
little elongations which are easily raised up, and which
then appear like small ends of thread when they are of
some size, but which exhibit only inequalities when they
are left very short, have all of them an oblique course,
and terminate in the pores which, we have said, pass
through the epidermis to go to its surface. Their existence
is sufficient, at the first inspection and without the
aid of a microscope, to enable us to distinguish the internal
from the external face of this membrane. The spaces
that separate them are more or less large. About these
spaces, the adhesions are less. It is at this place that the
small epidermoid vesicles are formed with which the
skin is covered when plunged into boiling water. The
depressed interstices, which separate these vesicles, are
the places where the exhalants are and which have prevented
the epidermis from being raised up. When ebullition
is long continued, they are detached also.</p>

<p>We cannot doubt then that all these vascular elongations
serve powerfully to unite the epidermis to the chorion.
How is the adhesion formed in their interstices? I know
not; but it exists, though it is less evident. The cellular
texture, as I have said, appears to take no part in it.</p>

<p>Every one knows that many causes destroy the adhesions
of the epidermis, and raise it up. These causes are,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">352</span>
1st, every severe inflammation, whatever may be its
species. We know that after erysipelas, phlegmon, biles,
and cutaneous eruptions of different natures, the epidermis
is always detached; there is then no fluid that raises it
up. The exhalants cannot furnish it, as they are full of
blood; it is dry when detached. 2d. Various cutaneous
eruptions, which have not an inflammatory character, as
herpes, &amp;c. also detach the epidermis at the place where
they are. It most commonly comes off then in the form
of dry scales; hence no doubt the idea of some authors
who have attributed to it a scaly structure, which neither
observation nor experiment upon the epidermis in the
natural state have proved. This pealing off in scales is
owing to the same cause precisely as the formation of
vesicles which take place the instant after the skin has
been plunged into boiling water, viz. to the greater adhesion
of the exhalant vessels which go to the epidermoid
pores. Observe in fact that it is always in the space between
these pores that the scales are produced, which do
not exist in nature, but which arise only from the manner
in which the membrane is raised up. For example, when
herpetic eruptions take place on the chin, the pores
through which the hairs pass are not detached; it is only the
epidermis in the space between these pores; now as these
are very near together, these scales are extremely small;
they are almost like dust. 3d. Whenever the epidermis
is raised up by cutaneous inequalities, the least friction
detaches it from these inequalities. Hence why, after
strong dry frictions, a rough skin becomes scaly, whilst
a smooth one experiences no alteration; it is this even,
which in the external appearance, contributes much to
the ugliness of the one and the beauty of the other. 4th.
After idiopathic fevers, and even many affections of the
internal viscera, the skin which has felt the sympathetic
influence of the disease, becomes the seat of an alteration
which without having any external sign, is sufficient to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">353</span>
break the union of it with the epidermis, which is everywhere
raised up. 5th. We know that the action of a
blister, which draws a large quantity of serum to the
external surface of the chorion, breaks off the exhalants
which go from it to the epidermis; so that this serum is
effused under it and forms a more or less considerable sac.
The water does not escape through the open pores, because
their oblique course through the epidermis makes
their parietes, when brought in contact with each other
by the pressure of the water, form an obstacle to it. It
is for the same reason, that though these pores may be
very evident, as I have said, in a separate portion of epidermis
when examined against the light, this portion will
support mercury, without giving passage to its particles.
6th. Most of the preceding means, which produce their
effect only by an alteration of the vital forces, have no
effect in raising the epidermis in the dead body. Putrefaction,
maceration and ebullition are those by which it
is effected. All act by breaking the elongations which
extend from the dermis to the epidermis, though the
mechanism of this rupture is not exactly known.</p>


<h4>II. <i>Organization, Composition, &amp;c.</i></h4>

<p>Authors have made many conjectures upon the structure
of the epidermis, which it would be useless to relate
here. I shall only speak of what accurate observation
demonstrates. Its thickness is in general very uniform
in all the parts. It has not appeared to me to be increased
or diminished, according to the varieties of thickness
of the skin on the back, the abdomen, the extremities,
&amp;c. It is only on the soles of the feet, the palms of
the hands and the corresponding face of the fingers, that
this thickness becomes greater. It is even so great in
these places, that there is no proportion between them
and the other parts of the body as it respects this mem<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">354</span>brane;
it is especially towards the heel that it exhibits
this character. This excessive thickness appears to be
owing to different layers which are applied upon each
other, and which seem to be superadded to the layer of
the ordinary epidermis; but there is also a real difference,
though but little known, in the organization; for
example, when the epidermis has been removed from
these parts by maceration, we cannot see, as in the others,
those small appendices or inequalities regularly scattered
over it, and which are the remains of the broken exhalants.
In these places these vessels are torn smoother on
the internal surface of the epidermis, on which are seen
only the traces of the wrinkles of which we have spoken.</p>

<p>I attribute to this excessive thickness of the epidermis
of the soles of the feet and the palms of the hands, the
difficulty and oftentimes impossibility of making blisters
act in these places, on which I have often applied them
there, because I thought that the sensibility being greater,
they would produce more effect in some diseases. The
failure of my attempts has compelled me to renounce them.</p>

<p>This thickness takes from the epidermis the transparency
it has in the other parts; it is whitish and opake
even on the hand and the foot. Thus the epidermis which,
in negroes not being coloured, allows the blackness of
the subjacent reticular texture to be seen, conceals in part
this blackness in these places. I have observed however,
by means of maceration, that the less deep colour of the
soles of the feet and the palms of the hands depends also
in this race upon this, that the reticular texture is really
less coloured. We might say that every thing relates to
animal sensibility in this region, the capillary net-work
of which appears to be less, and in which all the phenomena
that are derived from organic sensibility are much
less active.</p>

<p>In examining in this relation the hand and foot of a
negro, I have been led to make upon the colour of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">355</span>
reticular body some other experiments, which form a
short digression. 1st. By plunging into boiling water a
piece of the dermis taken from any part it becomes twice
as black, almost immediately; which is probably owing to
this, that the fibres in approximating by the horny hardening,
bring together the colouring particles, whence
arises a deeper black. This phenomenon is very striking,
when the piece plunged into the water is compared with
one that has not been. 2d. Maceration for a month or
two, sometimes removes the epidermis without the reticular
body, the seat of colour, and sometimes detaches the
whole together. 3d. Being immersed for some days in
cold water produces no sensible effect. 4th. Long continued
stewing hardly changes at all this colour, after the deep
tinge that has been suddenly given to it. Only by scraping
with a scalpel the external surface of the skin which is
then reduced to a kind of gelatinous pulp, we easily
detach the coloured reticular body from it, which however
always remains adherent to a small portion of the
chorion. 5th. Sulphuric acid, which reduces the skin
like all the other organs to a kind of pulpy state, also
enables us to remove this coloured portion easily, which
is detached in separate pieces, but the shade of which is
hardly altered at all. 6th. Nitric acid, though very much
weakened, does not facilitate so much the removal of this
coloured portion. It yellows the internal surface of the
skin and the epidermis; but it has appeared to me to produce
but very little effect upon the blackness of the reticular
body. 7th. A portion of the skin of a negro, immersed
for twenty-four hours in a solution of caustic potash,
has not appeared to me to have undergone any alteration
in its colour. I have made the same observation
when I used a weaker solution. 8th. Putrefaction detaches
the coloured portion of the skin, sometimes with the epidermis,
sometimes alone, but it does not alter its colour.
I have not employed other agents to ascertain the nature<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">356</span>
of this colour of the skin of negroes. Let us return to
the epidermis, which we have for a moment lost sight of.</p>

<p>Where it is very thick, as on the concave surface of
the foot and the hand, we see that it is evidently formed
by layers added to each other, and which are separated
with difficulty, because their adhesion is so intimate.
Everywhere except in the foot and the hand, there is but
a single layer; no fluid penetrates the epidermoid texture.
Cut in different directions either in the living or
dead body, it allows nothing to ooze through it. Their
scales are always dry; no blood vessel exists in them.
The absorbents and exhalants only pass through it without
anastomosing, without winding on its interior before opening
on its surface, as happens in the serous membranes,
which on this account become black by injection, though
but little blood appears to enter them during life. The
epidermis on the contrary is never coloured by this means,
even when the injection, being very fine and driven with
success, oozes out on the external surface of the skin.
Thus, in inflammation, in which all the cutaneous exhalants
are full of blood which they do not contain in the
natural state, this fluid never enters the epidermis, which
is uniformly disconnected with all the diseases of the
subjacent reticular body, and which, being only raised up
by inflammation, is detached and afterwards renewed.</p>

<p>The epidermis has evidently no nerves. It is also destitute
of cellular texture; thus fleshy granulations, which
are formed by this texture, never arise from this membrane;
the excrescences of which it is the seat have not
the character of the different tumours which the cellular
texture especially contributes to form, such as fungi,
schirri, &amp;c.</p>

<p>From this it is evident that none of the general systems
common to all the organs, enters into the epidermoid
system. It has not then the common base of every organized
part; it is as it were inorganic in this respect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">357</span></p>

<p>The epidermoid texture exhibits no fibre in its interior;
it has in general but little resistance, and is broken by a
slight distention, except on the fingers and the hand where
it resists more, on account of its thickness.</p>

<p>The action of the air hardly alters it at all. Only when
it is exposed to it after having been removed in the form
of a large layer, it hardens a little, becomes a little more
consistent, and is torn with less ease. It is of all the organs,
next to the hair and the nails, that which drying
changes the least in the natural state. It also becomes a
little more transparent by it; but resumes its ordinary
state when again immersed in water, which proves that it
contained a little of it in this state. The action of the
air, which is so quickly efficacious upon the skin in putrefaction,
leaves it then wholly untouched. It is only raised
up, but does not itself putrify. Separated in this way and
washed to cleanse it of the fetid substances that might
adhere to it, it exhales no bad odour. Kept a long time
in moist air, alone and well separated from the neighbouring
parts, it does not alter. It is, next to the hair and
the nails, the most incorruptible of the animal substances.
I have preserved a foot found in a cemetery, the skin
and fat of which are transformed into a fat, unctuous and
hard substance, which burns in the candle, whilst the
epidermis, which is very thick, is hardly changed at all
in its nature.</p>

<p>The action of water upon the epidermis can be considered
under many relations. 1st. During life it whitens
it, when it is some time in contact with it, and at the
same time wrinkles it at different points. We often see
this phenomenon in the hands on coming out of a bath;
but it is particularly evident after ten or twelve hours application
of an emollient cataplasm, in which the action
of the farina is nothing, and in which it is the water that
produces the whole effect. This whiteness of the epidermis
appears to be then owing to its having really imbibed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">358</span>
some of the fluid. It is the same phenomenon that takes
place on the serous, fibrous, membranes, &amp;c. which, having
become artificially transparent by drying, whiten
again when immersed in water. Here the epidermis,
naturally transparent, whitens by the addition of this
fluid. In this state it renders the sensibility of the papillÃ¦
infinitely more obtuse; I have often made the experiment
upon myself, by applying a cataplasm in the evening and
removing it the next morning. When the water is evaporated
which the epidermis has imbibed, it again becomes
transparent, wrinkles, resumes its natural state, and allows
the sensibility of the skin to be again apparent. This
phenomenon is especially observed upon the epidermis of
the foot and the hand, for it is not often as sensible elsewhere.
2d. In the dead body, the epidermis separated
from the skin, and immersed in water, whitens also, but
does not wrinkle. Left to macerate in water, it does not
undergo any putrid alteration. Only there rises on the
surface of the fluid many particles, which being in juxta-position,
form a whitish pellicle of the nature of which
I am ignorant. At the end of two or three months, the
epidermis thus left in water, softens, does not swell, and
is torn with great ease; it is not reduced to a pulp analogous
to that of the other organs thus macerated. 3d.
When stewed, the epidermis does not undergo, at the
instant of ebullition, a horny hardening like all the other
organs. Hence why, whilst by this horny hardening the
skin is much diminished in extent, the epidermis which
remains the same is obliged to be folded in different directions.
When the ebullition is continued, this membrane
becomes less resisting and breaks with great ease, but is
never reduced to gelatine, does not acquire a yellowish
colour, and does not become elastic like the organs which
furnish much of this substance; besides, we know that
the epidermoid texture does not combine with tannin,
and that it is even an obstacle to it when it tends to pene<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">359</span>trate
the skin. After long stewing, the different layers
which compose the epidermis of the palm of the hand,
and especially that of the sole of the foot, are separated
with great ease; this is the best way of seeing this lamellated
structure. Between these layers there is often
formed on the foot small vesicles filled with serum.</p>

<p>Caloric produces upon the epidermis phenomena wholly
different from those which the other systems experience
from the contact of this substance. A portion of this
membrane well dried by the action of the air, and exposed
to the flame of a candle, 1st, does not undergo
hardly at all the horny hardening, as a portion of skin
does when thus treated; 2d, it exhales a fetid odour analogous
to that of burnt horn, and different from that of all
the other textures when subjected to the same experiment;
3d, it burns with great ease, which does not take
place with any of the preceding systems when dried; it
is often even sufficient to put the fire to it at one end to
consume it entirely; 4th, at the place of the flame we
see a blackish bubbling fluid, from which often escapes
little burning drops, and which is very analogous to that
of a feather when burnt. It is evidently an oil which supports
the combustion by its great abundance, and which
does not appear to be found in as great quantity as in the
hair and the nails. This oil deserves particular examination;
it is that which gives out in burning so disagreeable
an odour, and which forms those burning and whitish
drops of which we have spoken. It appears to be of the
same nature as that which Bertholet obtained from the
hair in so great a proportion. After combustion there is
left a blackish charcoal, which I have not analyzed.</p>

<p>Light does not appear to have a great action upon the
epidermis, which I have found of the same colour, in portions
of skin blackened by it, and in those which have
been sheltered from it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">360</span></p>

<p>Nitric acid yellows very sensibly the epidermis, more
even than any other animal substance; but it does not
dissolve it without great difficulty. The sulphuric on the
contrary acts very powerfully upon it, especially when it
is a little concentrated. When it is drawn out after having
been a short time plunged in, it is found to be very thin,
extremely transparent, and almost similar in this respect
to the pellicle that is taken from an onion. This curious
phenomenon has often struck me. When left too long in
the acid, the epidermis is finally entirely dissolved in it.</p>

<p>The alkaline lies dissolve this membrane, but with difficulty.
Pure alkali has a very prompt action upon it.</p>

<p>Alcohol has no influence upon the epidermis.</p>


<h4>III. <i>Properties.</i></h4>

<p>The epidermis has but very little extensibility, since
the least cutaneous tumour can tear it and raise it up in
scales, as in herpes, or in larger pieces, as from a blister.
Yet it is not entirely destitute of it, as the vesicle proves
which is formed by this last. Its contractility of texture
is nothing. We observe, that when no longer distended,
this bladder remains flaccid and never contracts.</p>

<p>Every kind of animal sensibility is foreign to the epidermis.
We know that it can be pricked, cut or torn,
without being felt. It is especially on the palms of the
hands and the soles of the feet that these experiments are
easily made. The thickness of this membrane is such in
this place, that we can remove layers of it, as we see done
by those who try the edge of an instrument, that it is
possible even, as most cooks do, to put it in contact with
live coals, and that it is not impossible to carry a red hot
iron over it. It is by this insensibility that it blunts the
action of the acids, the caustic alkalies, and of all the
powerful stimuli, which when in contact with the dermis
laid bare by a blister, give excessive pain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">361</span></p>

<p>The epidermis differs from all the other organs that are
destitute, like it, of animal sensibility, as the cartilages,
the tendons, the aponeuroses, &amp;c. in this, that it is never
capable of acquiring it; whereas the others, if a little excited,
often take a degree of it superior to that of the
organs which naturally possess it. Whence does this
arise? From the fact, that in order that the animal sensibility
may arise in an organ it is necessary that the rudiments
of it should be there already, and that this organ
should enjoy organic sensibility, which, when raised by
irritation is transformed into animal; now the epidermis
appears to be destitute also of this last property, as well
as of insensible contractility. In fact, 1st, there is no
sensible circulation in it. 2d. The exhalants and absorbents
which go through it, are wholly foreign to it. 3d.
No morbid phenomenon, that supposes organic sensibility,
appears in the epidermis. It does not inflame; it is passive
in all cutaneous affections, and never partakes of them
notwithstanding its continuity. The impossibility of inflaming
makes it an obstacle, wherever it exists, to cutaneous
adhesions, which cannot take place until it is removed.
Its internal surface, raised by a blister, and reapplied
to the dermis by the evacuation of the serum of the
vesicle by means of a small puncture, never unites again.
4th. The excrescences of which it is the seat, as corns,
some indurations, &amp;c. are inert and dry like it, and without
internal circulation; if they are painful, it is from the
pressure upon the subjacent nerves, and not from themselves.
5th. No sensible operation is performed in the epidermis;
it is worn incessantly by friction, like inorganic
bodies, and it is afterwards reproduced.</p>

<p>This continual destruction of the epidermis has not sufficiently
arrested the attention of physiologists. The
following are the proofs of its reality; 1st, if with the
blade of a knife, we scrape strongly its external surface,
a large quantity of powder is removed which sulphuric<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">362</span>
acid easily dissolves, and which is greyish. The epidermis
whitens a little in this place, then resumes its
colour, especially if it is moistened. By scraping again,
we do not remove any more powder, it is necessary in
order to obtain it, to wait twelve or twenty hours. 2d.
This substance becomes superabundant, when the skin has
not been washed for a long time. Hence why those who
soak their feet that have not been cleaned for a long time,
detach so great a quantity of it. It is especially on the
sole of the foot that this substance is formed in abundance.
We often observe in dead bodies that it forms almost a
layer in addition to the epidermis, but which is very
distinct from it, and can be removed with ease. I attribute
this circumstance to the thickness which the epidermis
has in this place. We should no doubt find as much
upon the hand, were it not for the continual friction of
this part. We see it often on the patients in hospitals,
after remaining a long time in bed without having been
cleansed.</p>

<p>Water naturally removes this substance, that is produced
by the destruction of the epidermis, and, which, mixing
with the residue of transpiration, that the air cannot carry
off by evaporation, renders bathing, as I have observed, a
natural want. Though it may be neither exhaled nor absorbed,
and though its production may appear to be owing
to mechanical friction, yet we can, in its relation, consider
the epidermis as an emunctory of the body, since it is
renewed by a substance coming from the dermis, as fast
as it is removed.</p>

<p>It is evident, as the epidermis has no vital properties,
that it cannot be the seat of any kind of sympathies,
which are aberrations of these properties. Hence its life
is extremely obscure, I doubt even if it possesses vitality.
We might almost say that it is a semi-organized body,
inorganic even, which nature has placed between external
inanimate bodies and the dermis, which is com<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">363</span>pletely
organized, in order to assist their passage and
guard against their force.</p>

<p>The epidermis has a property very distinct from those
of most of the other systems; it is that of being reproduced
when it has been removed. It grows anew and is
formed again with an appearance exactly similar to what
it first exhibited; it is that which makes it differ from all
the other systems, as the cellular, which throw out vegetations
when they are laid bare, but which are only reproduced
in an irregular manner, and wholly different from
their natural state. How is the epidermis thus reproduced?
Is it the pressure of the atmospheric air which
renders the external surface of the skin callous? Is it the
air, which, by combining with the products which escape
from this surface, forms a new compound? I know not.
What is certain is, 1st, that this production is wholly different
from that of the internal organs; 2d, that it cannot
take place except upon the skin, and that the fine pellicle
that covers all the other cicatrized parts, after a wound
with loss of substance, does not resemble it at all and presents
even a texture wholly different. Thus this pellicle
is not raised up by the different means which raise the
epidermis; thus it often becomes the seat of acute sensibility
which is never the case with the epidermis. This
is what takes place especially in changes of weather, a
time in which the cicatrices become, as we know, very
painful; I have often observed, that not only the interior,
but the pellicle even of the cicatrix are then sensible.
Besides, when this pellicle is formed, red blood vessels
evidently penetrate it, whilst nothing similar is observed
in the formation of the epidermis.</p>

<p>It is this faculty of reproduction which is put in action
in many epidermoid excrescences, as in corns, and callosities
which have nothing in common but the name with
those which form the edge of fistulas, &amp;c. All these excrescences
are insensible, without vessels or nerves, of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">364</span>
same consistence and the same colour as the epidermis;
they are often removed from it and afterwards formed
again. It appears that external pressure has much influence
upon their development; too narrow shoes and the
solid bodies which are used on the hands of smiths and
other workmen are the frequent cause of them.</p>

<p>I preserved a great part of the skin of a man who died
at the HÃ´tel Dieu, and his epidermis, which was treble the
thickness from his birth and even in the womb of his
mother, that it is in the ordinary state, had been subject
during his life to a continual desquamation which made
the whole of it appear as if covered with herpes, though
nothing similar to this affection existed upon the dermis,
which was perfectly sound. The face alone was exempt
from this defect of conformation.</p>

<p>The epidermis is not only reproduced when the whole
of it has been removed, but also when the superficial layers
alone have been taken away, especially on the foot
and the hand on which other layers arise upon those
which the cutting has laid bare; which proves that they
are not, as has been said, the juices of the reticular body
which form it by drying.</p>


<h4>IV. <i>Development.</i></h4>

<p>Those who have thought that the epidermis is formed
by pressure, would be convinced that this is not the case
if they would examine that of the fÅ“tus, which is very
distinct, more even in proportion than many other systems.
We observe it when the skin begins to leave the
pulpy state of which we have spoken. At the end of the
fifth month, it has proportions analogous to those which
it will afterwards exhibit. It is very thick on the soles of
the feet and the palms of the hands, and very thin elsewhere;
it is easily detached by all the means we have
pointed out. We know that in a fÅ“tus that has died and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">365</span>
become putrid in the womb, it is found in great measure
detached. At the place of the umbilical cord, it is continued
in an insensible manner with the skin.</p>

<p>At birth, though it is in contact with a fluid that is new
to it, it does not undergo a great alteration; which proves
that the air has little or no agency in its formation. It
becomes thicker as we advance in age, and follows, in
this respect, nearly the same proportions as the skin.
Beyond the twenty-sixth or thirtieth year it increases no
more. I have often raised up in many places the epidermis
of an old person; it has not appeared to me to differ
much from that of the adult; it is a little more subject
to scale off and it is a little thicker. In some miserable
objects which come to hospitals, there is often vermin
in cracks of the epidermis, whose layers are afterwards
separated by them and in which they live; so that I have
seen the epidermis in this way conceal thousands of little
animals, which were evidently found between the layers
of this membrane, and which were not upon the reticular
body and the papillÃ¦. It is the only means that has shown
to me the lamellated structure of the epidermis, in any
other place than on the foot and the hand, in which I have
never seen vermin.</p>

<p>The cracks of the epidermis in old age appear to arise
from its dryness owing to the want of exhalation; it is
that which renders the skin so rough and harsh. What
contributes to it also is, that as it has many inequalities on
account of its numerous folds, frictions being more felt in
these prominent places, make the epidermis scale off;
thus in the adult the same cause renders it scaly on a
tubercular skin, whilst a skin that is smooth and well
distended with fat, undergoes every kind of friction without
desquamation.</p>

<h3>ARTICLE SECOND.<br />

<small>INTERNAL EPIDERMIS.</small></h3>

<p>All authors have admitted the epidermis of the mucous
membranes. It appears that most have believed that
it is only this portion of the skin which descends into the
cavities to line them. Haller in particular is of this opinion.
But the slightest inspection is sufficient to show,
that here as upon the skin, it forms only a superficial layer
over the papillary body and the chorion. Boiling water
which detaches it from the palate, the tongue and the
pharynx even, enables us to see the two other layers.</p>


<h4>I. <i>Epidermis of the origin of the Mucous Surfaces.</i></h4>

<p>The epidermis is very distinct upon all the origins of
the mucous system, upon the glans, the entrance of the
anus, the urethra, the nasal fossÃ¦, the mouth, &amp;c. It is
demonstrated in these places by the excoriations that take
place there, upon the lips especially, by dissection with
a very fine lancet, by the action of boiling water, maceration,
putrefaction and even epispastics, as is proved by the
fact that the ancients employed this method to make the
edges of a hare-lip raw. The delicacy of this epidermis
is much greater than on the skin; and as it is more in
the interior this delicacy increases. It is to this circumstance
that must be attributed the ease with which different
remarkable modifications are produced through this membrane,
when in galvanic processes, we arm with zinc the
surface of the tongue and with another metal the mucous
surface of the conjunctiva, the pituitary membrane, the
surface of the rectum, the gums, &amp;c. and bring in mediate
or immediate contact these different metals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">367</span></p>

<p>The mucous epidermis is quickly reproduced when it
has been removed. Destitute of every kind of animal
and organic sensibility, it is in this respect, destined like
the skin, to defend the very sensitive papillary body that
is subjacent to it. It is to its presence upon the mucous
membranes, that should be in part attributed the faculty
they have of being exposed to the air, and even to the
contact of external bodies, without exfoliating or inflaming
as in preternatural anus, prolapsus of the rectum, &amp;c.;
whilst the serous membranes cannot bear this contact
with impunity.</p>

<p>Besides, the nature of the mucous epidermis is the same
as that of the cutaneous. Submitted to the action of the
same agents, it gives the same results. The excrescences
formed on its surface are also analogous, though much
more rare. It becomes callous by pressure. Chopart relates
the case of a shepherd, whose urethra became so, from
frequently introducing a small stick to procure pleasure.
We know the density that this covering has in the stomach
of the gallinaceous animals, and in certain cases in which
the mucous membranes come out of the body as in prolapsus
of the rectum, the vagina, the womb, &amp;c. Sometimes
in those cases the pressure of the clothes produces in
this epidermis a thickness evidently greater than what is
natural to it; it is this which then makes these membranes
lose in part the bright red that characterizes them in
the interior.</p>


<h4>II. <i>Epidermis of the deep seated mucous surfaces.</i></h4>

<p>The epidermis gradually becomes more delicate, and is
soon almost insensible, on the internal mucous membranes.
1st. In the stomach, the intestines, the bladder,
the gall-bladder, the vesiculÃ¦ seminales, in all the excretories,
&amp;c. the most delicate instrument cannot raise it up.
2d. In the maceration and ebullition of the mucous sys<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">368</span>tem
of these parts, I have never seen the epidermis raised
up on its surface. 3d. I have drawn out of the abdomen
of a dog a portion of intestine; its mucous coat has been
laid bare by an incision, and I have applied an epispastic
to it; more redness was seen upon the free surface of this
coat, but no pellicle was raised up from it. 4th. We do
not see in preternatural anuses, complicated with inversion,
excoriations analogous to those of which the surface
of the lips, that of the glans, &amp;c. are the seat. 5th. I have
already had frequent occasion to open bodies affected with
acute or chronic catarrhs of the intestines, the stomach,
the bladder, &amp;c.; now I have never seen the epidermis
separated by inflammation, as happens after erysipelas,
phlegmon, &amp;c. upon the cutaneous organ. 6th. We do
not see upon the deep seated mucous surfaces those exfoliations,
desquamations, &amp;c. so frequent upon this after
many affections.</p>

<p>From all these considerations it would appear, that the
epidermis does not exist upon the deep seated mucous
surfaces, and the great quantity of mucous juices constantly
poured out by the subjacent glands, supplies its
place in defending the papillÃ¦ and the chorion from the
impression of substances heterogeneous to the economy,
contained in the internal cavities. Yet there is a circumstance
that would seem to demonstrate the existence of
the epidermis upon the deep seated mucous surfaces; it
is the separation of preternatural membranes, which are
often detached from these surfaces, and which may be
considered as a kind of epidermoid exfoliation. Many
authors give examples of these membranes formed either
upon the bladder and voided by the urethra, or upon the
stomach and Å“sophagus and thrown up by vomiting, or
upon the intestines and expelled with the alvine evacuations;
Haller has collected many cases. Dr. Montaigu
informed me that he saw a membrane vomited up, which
formed a sac without a rent, exactly analogous to that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">369</span>
of the stomach whose internal surface it lined. Desault
saw a sac almost analogous to the bladder, voided by a
patient who was affected with retention of urine.</p>

<p>I confess that I have made no observation on this point,
so that I cannot say what is the nature of these membranes.
But authors in general agree in attributing to
them a soft and pulpy nature, which does not appear to
me to accord with that of the epidermis. I have many
times seen at the HÃ´tel Dieu white membranes detached
from the Å“sophagus after poisoning with the nitric acid.
But these membranes are evidently the superficial portion
of the mucous organ, which is disorganized, and thrown
off by suppuration which takes place below. It is thus
that cutaneous eschars fall off in the form of membranes
from large burns; in this way the osseous layers are
formed in necrosis, which are only the superficies of the
bone that dies and is detached in a lamellated form.</p>

<p>From this, the existence of the epidermis of the deep
seated mucous surfaces appears to me to be very uncertain,
and cannot be admitted till a new examination,
which will, I think, prove rather against than in favour
of its existence. What is the place in which the epidermis
terminates that lines the origin of the mucous surfaces,
or if it exists everywhere, where does it begin to
become no longer apparent from the action of our different
reagents? We cannot, I think, determine with precision;
it diminishes in an insensible manner, and is lost
as it were by degrees.</p>


<hr class="chap" />

<h3>ARTICLE THIRD.<br />

<small>OF THE NAILS.</small></h3>

<p>All the fingers have at their extremity, on the outer
side or that of extension, hard, transparent and elastic lay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">370</span>ers,
of the nature of the horns of many animals, and
which are called nails.</p>


<h4>I. <i>Forms, Extent, Relations, &amp;c.</i></h4>

<p>The nails of man differ from those of most other animals,
in their breadth and want of thickness. The first
makes them better adapted to support the extremity of
the fingers, which is broader than in most animals for the
perfection of touch; the second renders them less fit to
serve for defence or as a means of aggression.</p>

<p>Most people cut their nails even with their fingers, so
that the length of these bodies which is seen is not what
is natural to them. When allowed to grow, they lengthen
and turn over on the side of flexion, and cover entirely
the lower end of the fingers. This growth has a certain
limit which the nail cannot pass, and which it attains
when it exhibits at its extremity a cutting and sharp edge.
As long as this edge has the appearance of having a part
cut off, the nail continues to grow.</p>

<p>We usually think that the habit of cutting our nails is
a thing of mere decorum. But if we reflect a little upon
society and the numerous arts to which it gives rise, upon
the perfection, delicacy, precision and rapidity of the motions
which the fingers are often forced to execute, upon
the necessity of approximating them, crossing them in a
thousand different ways, &amp;c. we shall soon see that this
habit is almost inevitably the result of the social state, and
what appears to us the effect of fashion is that of necessity.
The sense of touch in man in a natural state is
coarse and obscure; it is only necessary that he should
seize objects destined for his nourishment, his defence,
his aggressions, &amp;c. that he should climb especially and
attach himself to trees to keep himself upon them; now
his nails are for this purpose of great use. What he loses
in this respect in society, he seems to gain by the pre<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">371</span>cision
and extent which are added to his touch, and by the
faculty which the fingers acquire of distinguishing the
most delicate tangible qualities. In the first state, his
hands are of great assistance to him in locomotion. In
the second, they contribute hardly at all to this use, and
they gain in the partial motions of their fingers what they
lose in their motions as a whole, which become of less
urgent necessity.</p>

<p>The nail has three distinct parts in the natural state;
one posterior, concealed on both sides by the integuments;
another middle, free only on one side, and the third anterior,
without adhesion at either side.</p>

<p>The posterior portion of the nail is nearly a sixth part
of its extent. Its convex surface adheres very intimately
to the epidermis, which goes in the following manner to
fix it. After having covered over the portion of the
finger corresponding with flexion, it is reflected upon the
concave edge where the skin terminates and where the
nail begins to become external; it commonly forms all
around this edge a kind of small string that is very distinct
and has a small groove in the top of it, and which
is evidently composed entirely of epidermis, since we can
cut the whole of it without giving any pain, and which is
afterwards easily reproduced. After having formed this
string, which is in the form of a parabola, the epidermis
is again reflected, passes between the skin and the nail,
and is glued, if we may so say, to the concave surface of
the latter, without being intermixed with it; for we can
remove it with ease by scraping with a scalpel. So that
the dermis which covers the superior portion is really between
two layers of epidermis. After having thus fixed
the nail, and having arrived at its posterior edge, the epidermis
is continued and identified as it were with this
edge, whose evident delicacy and softness approximate it
in nature to this membranous layer. Hence it follows
that without the adhesion of the epidermis to the nail,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">372</span>
there would be between them, a kind of cul-de-sac. Some
authors have thought that the extensor tendon is extended
as far; but it is easy to see that it does not go beyond the
tubercle which terminates behind the phalanx. The nail
does not reach this tubercle, there is a space of three lines
between them. The concave surface of the posterior
portion of the nail corresponds with the same substance
as the middle portion.</p>

<p>This middle portion is bare on its convex surface, which
is smooth, whitish behind where this colour forms a kind
of half moon, reddish in the greater part of its extent, a
colour which is foreign to it and which it derives from
the subjacent texture. Upon the sides, the skin covers
this surface a little, and terminates afterwards by continuing
the concave and free edge of which we have spoken.
The epidermis forms also in this place a small string
which is continued on each side with that pointed out
above; then it unites to the nail and adheres to its lateral
edges with which it is identified. The concave surface
of this middle portion is fixed in front by the epidermis,
which, after having covered the extremity of the fingers,
and having arrived at the place where the nail ceases to
be free, is separated from the dermis, and adheres to the
whole length of the nail in a curved line; then by mixing
with it, it seems to form its internal lamina. The
dermis on the contrary is continued on the convexity of
the last phalanx, has there a remarkable consistence, a
reddish appearance, and a texture like pulp and wholly
different from what is observed elsewhere; more vessels
run through it; there is no distinct space in it, and no
elongation goes from it to the surface of the nail of which
the epidermis forms a part. We do not see on this surface,
as on those of the other parts of the epidermis, those
threads, which are the remains of the broken exhalants
and of which we have spoken; thus the sweat never
passes through the nail. There is neither any oily oozing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">373</span>
upon its surface; whence it follows that water is not formed
into little drops on the exterior of its horny laminÃ¦.
Hence the nail is evidently insulated from all the other
organs except the epidermis, with which it is continued
on its concave face and especially on its posterior and
lateral edges. Thus observe that when collections of pus
or other affections have broken this continuity behind or
on the sides, the whole of the nail, though unaffected in
the middle falls off.</p>

<p>The free or anterior portion of the nail is of a length
which it is difficult to determine. I have never seen it
allowed to take its natural growth. I have only observed
that if it is permitted to grow to a considerable size, we
see evidently that it has a greater thickness than the posterior
and middle portion. In general, the thickness,
resistance and hardness of the nail increase in a gradual
manner from the posterior to the anterior part; we shall
now examine to what this is owing.</p>


<h4>II. <i>Organization; Properties, &amp;c.</i></h4>

<p>In order to observe the organization of the nails advantageously,
it is necessary to take those that are very distinct,
as those of the great toe, the thumb, &amp;c. We then
see evidently that a single lamina occupies the whole of
their convex surface. Behind, this lamina exists alone;
hence the extreme thickness of the nails at this place.
But as we examine towards the front, we see new laminÃ¦
successively added to it, on the concave surface; so that
the nail becomes successively thicker. These laminÃ¦ can
be easily raised up layer by layer. The most anterior
are the shortest. They often exhibit upon the concave
surface of the nail an infinite number of very evident
small striÃ¦, all longitudinal and parallel, and which make
us attribute to it a fibrous texture. At other times this
arrangement is less evident.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">374</span></p>

<p>What is the nature of the laminÃ¦ which form the nails?
I believe that they are almost precisely the same as the
epidermis. What proves it is, 1st, that the most superficial
is evidently continued with it by its edges; there is
no intermediate agent between them. 2d. I have already
observed that the nails are detached, and then regenerated
exactly like the epidermis. They have two modes
of increase; one in length, when we cut their extremities;
the other in thickness, when we detach only a lamina,
which is soon formed again. When the whole of
the nail comes off, all the portion of the dermis which
covers the back of the last phalanx, contributes at the
same time to form it anew by its external surface. 3d.
There is the same obscurity in the vitality of the nails as
in that of the epidermis. No trace of animal sensibility
is discoverable in them. The excruciating pain that is
experienced when they are pulled out arises solely from
the sensibility of the subjacent pulpy texture; it is from
the same cause as in pulling out the hair. There is no
organic sensibility, no internal circulation and consequently
no heat inherent in the texture of the nails; thus
the horns of animals are nearly of the same degree of
temperature as the atmosphere, whilst some external productions
with evident vital forces, though raised up like
horns, have a temperature equal to that of the body.
Such are the combs of the cock of our country, and those
which are more striking of the cock-turkey. Compare
these excrescences with those on the feet of these animals,
which are horny, and the difference of temperature is
evident. 4th. The nails give out when burning a disagreeable
odour, analogous to that of the epidermis under
the same circumstances; they exhibit then the same phenomena.
Their combustion is supported, like that of the
epidermis, by an oil of which they contain a great quantity.
5th. If maceration and stewing do not produce
upon the nails that want of consistence, that kind of brit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">375</span>tleness,
if I may so express myself, which they produce
upon the epidermis, it appears to be owing only to their
greater solidity. 6th. The action of the nitric, sulphuric
acids, &amp;c. has exhibited to me nearly the same phenomena
as upon the epidermis.</p>

<p>Every thing then appears to establish the most exact
analogy in the composition, organization and properties
of the nails and the epidermis. There is no doubt a difference
of principles between them, since the appearance
is not the same, and since, though many epidermoid
layers may be in juxta position as on the soles of the feet
and the palms of the hands, they do not exhibit the form
and texture of the nails; so that we cannot consider these
as mere layers of epidermis applied to each other. Chemists
must ascertain what these differences are, which are certainly
very slight. Thus nature often employs indifferently
the two organs for the same uses; it is thus that
on the sole of the foot of man and many analogous species,
there is a thick epidermis; whilst on the feet of animals
with hoofs, we see a horny substance of the nature of the
human nail.</p>

<p>An evident proof of the slight degree of internal motion
which is going on in the epidermis and the nails, of the
kind of inertia in which they are in relation to the constant
motion of composition and decomposition, which
constitutes nutrition, and of the insensibility which they
exhibit to various excitants, is the ease with which they
are penetrated by different colouring substances, and the
very long time they retain them. We know this effect
with regard to the nails of dyers. Many savage people
who paint the face, various parts of the body, and often
even the whole of the external surface of the body, preserve
for a long time, without a new coat, the colour
which they have artificially given themselves. I have
removed the epidermis of a portion of skin of the arm of
a dead body, which was coloured blue during life; this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">376</span>
colour was not only on the surface of the membrane, but
penetrated the whole of it, like a piece of cloth that had
been soaked in it. Yet the pores were as evident as before,
and the sweat could pass through them; I presume
this secretion goes on as usual in savages who paint the
skin. Thus the cloth which is immersed in a dye, has
not its pores closed by it. I may make use of this comparison,
as the epidermis and the nails are really species
of inorganic bodies. Lay any organ bare and paint it in
this way; the colour, together with the contact of the
air will irritate and inflame it, and the suppuration arising
from this inflammation will soon throw out the colouring
particles, which nutrition would have done, if inflammation
had not. There is a means however which can perpetuate
the colour, even upon organs, which, very sensible
like the skin, are constantly subject to the double nutritive
motion; it is that of using the colours with a red
hot iron. It is in this way I am convinced that the letters
or coloured figures which most soldiers mark upon themselves,
with a red hot pin, have their seat not only in the
epidermis, but also in the chorion itself.</p>


<h5><i>Development.</i></h5>

<p>The nails have in the fÅ“tus a very considerable consistence,
whilst the skin is still pulpy; but their tenuity
is then extreme. But they thicken and acquire greater
consistence as the fÅ“tus increases in size. They have
not at birth a length proportionable to what they are afterwards
to have. They do not extend beyond the ends of
the fingers which are often much the longest; so that it is
not till after birth that they are bent over and exceed the
fingers in length, for both of these would be useless in
the womb of the mother, as there is nothing there for the
fÅ“tus to seize upon. Their transparency allows us evidently
to see, at the moment of birth, first the black colour
of the blood which before circulated in the arteries, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">377</span>
then the vermilion colour which respiration suddenly imparts
to it. As we advance in age, the nails grow in the
same proportions as the epidermis, but they have nothing
peculiar in their growth. In old people they become extremely
thick.</p>

<p>These organs experience during life those diseases only
which are analogous to those of the epidermis. These
are excrescences, augmentations of size, &amp;c. and other
productions, the texture of which is precisely the same as
that of the nail, and in which there is neither more sensibility,
nor more circulation, nor more heat, nor more
life; a remarkable character which distinguishes them
from those tumours which arise upon the other organs
with very active vitality, as upon the skin, the muscles,
&amp;c. tumours the texture of which is very different from
that of the organs which have produced them, and which
most usually have properties entirely different. But the
epidermoid excrescences are in every respect analogous
to the epidermis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">379</span></p>



<h2 id="PILOUS_SYSTEM">PILOUS SYSTEM.</h2>


<p>The adjective by which I characterize this system, is
derived from the latin substantive which signifies the organs
of which it is composed. Hair is found less generally
upon man than upon most other animals. It forms
upon them a kind of covering external to the skin, which,
lessening in part the contact of external bodies, makes the
cutaneous animal sensibility perform a less important part,
and establishes less numerous relations between these
bodies and them. External life is then, in this respect,
more limited in them than in man, in whom a delicate
epidermis and a few hairs thinly scattered over it, separate
the organ of feeling from surrounding objects, the
least impression of which is felt, and which, owing to
this, keep the animal sensibility in permanent activity;
thus man is designed to live more without than within
himself. The pleasures of reproduction and digestion
constitute exclusively the happiness of animals. That of
man is in part the result of them; but an order of pleasures
wholly different, purely intellectual and in relation
only with external sensations, enlarges immensely by its
presence, and contracts by its absence, the field of this
happiness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">380</span></p>

<p>The hair of man covers especially the cranium, some
parts of the face, the front of the trunk, the genital organs,
the extremities, &amp;c. The quantity varies remarkably,
as well as the form, length, &amp;c. In order to form an
accurate idea of it, we shall now consider it separately in
the different organs, we shall then treat of its general organization,
properties and development.</p>


<hr class="chap" />

<h3>ARTICLE FIRST.<br />

<small>EXAMINATION OF THE PILOUS SYSTEM IN THE DIFFERENT
REGIONS.</small></h3>

<p>This system must be considered on the head, the trunk
and the extremities.</p>


<h4>I. <i>Pilous System of the Head.</i></h4>

<p>The head is the part of the body in which this system
predominates; it covers the whole cranium and defends
it against the impression of external bodies, as the hairy
coat of quadrupeds defends them. Thus this part is the
least capable of exercising the sense of touch, either from
the obscurity of the animal sensibility arising from this
hairy covering, or because its convex form allows it to be
in contact with external bodies only by a small surface.</p>

<p>The face is less generally covered with hairs, though
many are found upon it, especially in men. This part,
in which in a very small space are collected the greatest
number of our means of communication with external
objects, viz. the organs of taste, smell, sight and even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">381</span>
hearing, has but very little to do with the sense of touch,
on account of its villous arrangement. Its form is also
badly adapted to this sense. The mouth which is flattened
cannot be applied to external bodies. Thus whilst
the snout which is elongated in most quadrupeds, performs
the double function of first feeling all bodies, turning
them in various directions in order to ascertain their
tangible qualities, and then of seizing them for nourishment,
the mouth of man serves only for this last use; it is
the hands which are destined for the first. Thus observe
that all animals, even the most of those with clavicles,
almost uniformly direct their snout towards the earth,
whilst the mouth of man is naturally destined to an opposite
position.</p>


<h5><i>Of the Hairs of the Head.</i></h5>

<p>They occupy upon the cranium all the space which
corresponds with the occipital, parietal, the squamous
portion of the temporal and a small portion of the frontal
bones. Their limits do not vary on the sides; they
always correspond above the ear. Behind, they sometimes
go down upon the superior part of the neck; at
others, they do not extend beyond the head. In applying
blisters on the ligamentum nuchÃ¦, we observe in this
respect, almost as many varieties as there are subjects.
We know how variable these limits are in front. Sometimes
extended lower down, sometimes carried higher up,
sometimes describing a curved line, and at others forming
a real triangle the anterior point of which corresponds
with the median line, they have really nothing constant.</p>

<p>These inequalities alone determine the breadth or narrowness
of the forehead, whilst its degrees of inclination
depend solely upon the bone which forms it. It is in this
way that the hair contributes a little to the expression of
the face; I say a little, for it is less to the breadth of the
forehead than to its approximation to a perpendicular,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">382</span>
that we attach the ideas of majesty and greatness which
characterize heroes and gods. The poets, as we know,
have particularly celebrated the forehead of the god of
thunder. Observe in relation to this subject that there is
a great difference between that which expresses majesty
or abjectness in the face, from that which serves there
to express the passions. It is the osseous structure of
this region and the degree of inclination resulting from
this structure, which serve for the first use, and it is especially
the muscular motions which contribute to the
second. Why? Because majesty, grandeur, &amp;c. are especially
connected with the extent of the understanding, and
the understanding has its seat in the brain, and because
the various capacities of the cranium, which contain this
organ, and which correspond with its various degrees of
development, have inevitably an influence upon the different
dimensions of the face. Now as the bony structure
is a thing constant and invariable, the air of majesty
or abjectness remains always imprinted upon the face.
On the contrary, the passions which especially affect the
epigastric organs, which afterwards excite the facial muscles,
have necessarily a transitory expression.</p>

<p>The number of hairs is very variable on the same surface.
In some people they are very close together and
even all touch; in others more thinly scattered, they
allow in part the skin of the cranium to be seen in their
interstices, a circumstance which is either owing to original
conformation, or to a disease which makes them fall
out in part. They have, like the nails, a determinate
growth which they do not exceed. We know but
little of the limit of this growth. Yet we have seen them
reach to the waist, the thighs, and the legs even. It appears
that in women they have a greater growth; we
might say, that nature has compensated this sex in this
way for the want of hair in many other parts. Floating
upon the shoulders, the breast, the trunk, &amp;c. they form<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">383</span>
in the natural state a sort of protection from the injuries
of the air and the light. Their extent evidently proves
that man was destined to an erect attitude. In fact, in
the attitude of quadrupeds, they would trail much upon
the earth, and form an obstacle to motion. The hair of
no animal, I believe, in a natural attitude retards his progress
so much, as the hair of man then would.</p>

<p>Man, who opposes nature in every thing, has made it
a habit in most societies to cut the hair, the beard, &amp;c.
By common people, it is considered merely a thing of
fashion; by the physician, as a practice which has perhaps
a greater influence than is thought upon the functions.
In fact, in the natural state when the pilous system
has once acquired its growth, it no longer exhibits the
constant motion of composition and decomposition. On
the contrary, in man who cuts it, it is constantly the seat
of this motion and of that of growth. This practice perpetuates
then the phenomena which take place in them
in infancy, and consequently keeps up there a more active
work, which perhaps is performed at the expense of that
of many other parts.</p>

<p>The natural difference of the hair has much influence
upon its length; that which is smooth and curls but
little is in general the longest. The more it has the opposite
characters, the shorter it is, as is proved by that of
negroes and those white people whose hair curls like
theirs.</p>

<p>The tenuity of the hair is very great, yet its resistance
is in proportion very considerable. There is no part in
the economy, not even those of the fibrous system, which
can support so great a weight in proportion to its size.
Thus woven strings of hair would have an enormous
resistance, if they were sufficiently long to be employed
for different uses.</p>

<p>The colour of the hair varies remarkably according to
country, latitude, climate, temperature, &amp;c. This colour<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">384</span>
is even, like that of the skin, a characteristic attribute of
the different human races. Naturalists have been much
occupied with this subject, and I refer to their works.</p>

<p>In our climate the principal colours are black, flaxen
and bright red. They are, as it were, the three general
types to which may be referred many particular shades.
The black has under it the brown, the chesnut, &amp;c. The
flaxen is connected on the one hand with the bright
red and on the other with the chesnut. The bright red
which touches the flaxen by one of its extreme shades,
goes by an opposite shade to the natural colour of certain
flames.</p>

<p>All physicians have considered the colour of the hair
as among the characters of the temperaments. Black indicates
strength and vigour. The figure of a wrestler
with flaxen hair would be almost ridiculous. This colour
is the attribute of weakness and delicacy; it floats upon
the head of figures which painters have made strangers
to the great passions, to powerful and heroic deeds; it is
found upon the figures of young people, in pictures where
laughter, sport, grace and pleasure preside over the subjects.
These two colours, black and flaxen, as well as
their secondary shades, are found distributed among
women in nearly equal proportion; now reflect upon the
kind of sentiment this sex inspires according to the colour
of the hair, without regard to any other consideration,
and you will see that a woman with flaxen hair creates a
sentiment which beauty and weakness united seem to
dictate. The epithets that we employ express this double
attribute. On the contrary, the term brunette announces
in her that it designates, a mixture of force and beauty.
Beauty is then a common gift which attracts us, but
which, differently modified by external forms, attracts us
by touching, interesting and exciting us. Eyes in which
langour is depicted, are frequently associated with flaxen
hair; whilst black hair is almost always met with, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">385</span>
those whose vivacity and sparkling seem to proclaim an
excess of life which seeks to be diffused.</p>

<p>Habit which accustoms us to every thing, changes our
taste in regard to the colour of the hair, as it does to
that of our dress. Black, flaxen and their numerous shades
are in turns fashionable in France; and as the organization
does not change with our taste, we have contrived
artificial hair; a happy means, which seems to subject to
our inconstancy the invariable course of nature, and which,
changing at our will the expression which the physiognomy
borrows from the hair, can at every instant exhibit
man under forms which fashion extols to day, and which
ridicule pursues tomorrow. Now among these numberless
variations which succeed each other among us in the
fashion of the hair, bright red and its various shades never
find a place. Most people have a decided aversion to it.
It is almost, in our eyes, a mal-formation to be born with
it. This opinion is too general not to have some real
foundation. The principle appears to me to be the usual
connexion between the hair and the temperament and of
course the character which results from this; now the
kind of character connected with this kind of hair is not
commonly the happiest, though there are many exceptions
to this principle, which is proverbial. Another reason
for the aversion to hair of a bright red, is that the oily
fluid which lubricates it often exhales a fetid odour foreign
to the other kinds of hair.</p>

<p>What is the relation that can exist between the hair
and the character? Has the first an influence upon the
second? No; the following is the way in which it should
be considered. Every man has his peculiar kind of organization
and constitution. This forms the temperament;
now, to each kind is attached on the one hand this or that
species of hair, and on the other the predominance of
some internal viscera, which though less apparent is not
less real. This predominance disposes evidently to certain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">386</span>
passions, which are the principal attributes of character;
then the colour of the hair and character are two different
results from the same cause, viz. constitution; but one
has no influence upon the other.</p>

<p>The hair coming out of the cutaneous pores has such a
direction, that that of the anterior part of the cranium is
almost always oblique in front, and tends to fall over the
forehead; that of the middle and posterior part pierces
the skin perpendicularly, and that of the posterior and inferior
part traverses it obliquely, so as to fall naturally
down the length of the posterior part of the neck. It is
the same with that of the sides, which its direction as
well as its weight, carries upon the region of the ear which
it covers.</p>


<h5><i>Eyebrows.</i></h5>

<p>Upon the arch which borders the orbit above, is found
a collection of hairs forming a portion of a circle more or
less evident, which shades the eye and defends it from the
too powerful impression of the rays of light. The hairs
of the eyebrows are thicker together in persons of dark
complexion, than in those of light. More numerous
within, they sometimes unite together the two eyebrows
upon the nasal prominence, and thus shade the root of the
nose. Fewer without, they there cause the eyebrow to
terminate in a point. All are obliquely directed from
within outwards. Sometimes towards the internal side,
they go perpendicularly forwards. Their length is scarcely
more than half an inch; they do not exceed this except in
some extraordinary cases. Their colour is usually, though
not invariably, the same as that of the hair. They are
firmer, more resisting and larger than the hairs of the head.
If they were longer they would curl like the hairs on the
genital parts, of the nature of which they partake.</p>

<p>The eyebrows enjoy two evident motions. 1st. They
are depressed and carried inwards, by forming over the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">387</span>
eye a very evident arch. 2d. They are raised up and
separated from each other, by expanding the parts around
the orbit. The length between the extremes of these two
motions is nearly an inch. The first motion takes place
to defend the eye from a very bright light. It expresses
also the melancholy and gloomy passions; hence the reason
no doubt why the same word is applied to the moral
state of the mind, and to the row of hairs of which we
are treating. Observe on this subject that the sanguineous
and choleric temperaments, which are the most disposed
to the passions which make the eyebrows contract, are
precisely those in which the hairs that compose them are
found in general the most evident. The second motion
enables us to receive upon the region of the orbit a great
quantity of the rays of light; it allows us to raise the
upper eyelid to a great extent in order to open the eye
wide, which the first evidently prevents. It expresses
also the gay passions, those which dilate the face. Painters
have studied more than anatomists, the different degrees
of elevation and depression of the eyebrows.</p>


<h5><i>Eyelashes.</i></h5>

<p>Upon both eyelids there exists a small row of hairs, a
little longer than those of the eyebrows, of the same
nature as them, directed obliquely forwards, crossing each
other when the two eyelids are brought together, and
serving to defend the eye from the small particles floating
in the air. In general they do not curl; when they do
and turn towards the eye, an irritation ensues, and they
must be cut off. Sometimes a bad direction is the cause
of this irritation.</p>

<p>I would remark on the subject of the eyelashes, that all
the openings of communication with the interior, as those
of the meatus auditorius externus, the nose and the anus,
and oftentimes also the orifices of the lactiferous tubes,
are surrounded with a great number of hairs which defend<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">388</span>
these openings from external bodies. Around the mouth
the beard takes the place of these hairs; the urethra has
none, but the prepuce at its orifice is instead of them.</p>


<h5><i>Beard.</i></h5>

<p>The males of most animals are distinguished from the
females by some external productions. The comb of the
cock, the mane of the lion, the horns of the stag, &amp;c. are
examples of these distinctive characters. In man, the
beard is the principal attribute of the male. It occupies
all the chin, the sides of the face, both lips and the superior
part of the neck. It leaves the cheeks bare as well
as the parts around the eyes; thus observe that it is there
that the passions are principally depicted, the expression
of which would be concealed by the hairs, if the lower
part of the face was the seat of them.</p>

<p>The beard, not so long in general as the hair of the
head, is longer than that of every other part of the body.
It is very commonly of the colour of the first, though
more rarely flaxen and is more frequently of a bright red,
which it often is in persons with flaxen hair. The nature
of the hairs of the beard is the same as that of the hairs
of the genital parts, the eyebrows, &amp;c. They curl, are
stiffer, more resisting and uniformly less oily than the
hair of the head.</p>

<p>The quantity of beard varies remarkably in different
men. Those in whom it is abundant and of a deep black
are in general strong and vigorous. Observe also that
the strongest males in the different species of animals are
those, in whom the external production which distinguishes
them from the females, is the most conspicuous.
We might say that this characteristic production is the index
of the strength or weakness of their constitution. A
small lion has not a noble mane; great horns belong to a
well made stag, and long, twisted ones to a good formed
ram. Observe that it is not the same with the other hairs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">389</span>
common to the two sexes. Often in a weak man, those
of the arms, the thighs, &amp;c. are as evident and even more
numerous, than in the most muscular.</p>

<p>The habit of cutting the beard as most Europeans do,
of preserving it like the Asiatics and of dressing it in different
ways like the Chinese, gives a different expression
to the face which characterizes the people. A masculine,
vigorous physiogomy which expresses strength and energy,
cannot be deprived of this external attribute without
losing a part of its character. That of the Orientals exhibits
an appearance which coincides with the strength of
their bodies, and forms a contrast with the effeminacy of
their manners. I do not know if, in consulting the history
of the different people who allow their beard to
grow, and that of nations who cut it, we might not be
tempted to believe that muscular force is to a certain extent
connected with its existence, and that this force is
always diminished a little when we are constantly deprived
of it. Every one knows the vigour of the ancients,
that of the people with long beards, and that even
of certain men who, among us, allow their beards to grow
in conformity with the laws of monkish institutions. No
doubt many causes may make weakness exist with a
beard; but in a general view I think we can admit that
there is a certain relation between it and strength. Take
from a cock his comb, which is the characteristic of the
male, as the beard is that of man, and he will lose strength.
I am persuaded that we might take from the lion a part
of his power by taking away his mane. We know the
result of the experiments of Russel upon the castration
of stags; their horns, after this operation have grown in
an irregular manner, or have not even grown at all. This
external attribute of the male in this species, appears as
we know at the period of virility, when the vital forces
are increased. It is the same with the human beard.
This coincidence would alone prove that the use of this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">390</span>
last is to serve for an external character to the male sex.
The eunuch, whose powers are feeble, loses also oftentimes
much of his beard.</p>

<p>Such are our prejudices in regard to the idea we form
of beauty, that we ridicule what is really and absolutely
so, for that is certainly so which indicates organic perfection.
A peacock without his tail of emeralds, a ram
or a stag without their horns, displease us; why does
not man without his beard?</p>


<h4>II. <i>Of the Pilous System of the Trunk.</i></h4>

<p>The hairs on the trunk are very variable. Some men
appear as it were shaggy, whilst others are almost without
hairs. There are more of them generally on the anterior
than on the posterior part of the trunk. It is principally
along the linea alba and upon the chest, that they
are found in man. This last part is in general destitute
of them in woman, who has usually very few on the
trunk.</p>

<p>Both sexes have a very considerable quantity on the
genital parts. They are there, as I have said, of the
nature of the beard. Less frequently flaxen than the
hair of the head, as frequently of a bright red, they are
most usually black. They are, next to the beard, the
longest hairs. They have generally no determinate direction;
each hair almost has a different one. Few animals,
like man, exhibit this excess of hair upon the genital parts.
There is a great difference in individuals as to its quantity.
The blackness and abundance coincide in general with
strength.</p>


<h4>III. <i>Pilous System of the Extremities.</i></h4>

<p>Man has many hairs upon the whole surface of his extremities.
The proportion of number is nearly the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">391</span>
in all; but the length varies very much; in some, they
form only a down; in others, they are a little longer;
whilst in others, they are nearly of an inch in length,
reach over each other, and give the extremities a shaggy
appearance.</p>

<p>At the top of the superior extremities, there is in the
hollow of the axilla a collection of hairs which are longer
than the others, and are nearly of the nature of those of
the genital parts. Nothing similar is seen on the inferior
extremities.</p>

<p>The pilous system does not exist on the internal part of
the arm and fore-arm in many men, in whom we see it
only behind and on the sides. It is more uniform on the
inferior extremities. The back of the foot and hand
always have hairs. They are never seen on the sole of
the one or the palm of the other; a circumstance of essential
advantage to the perfection of touch.</p>


<hr class="chap" />

<h3>ARTICLE SECOND.<br />

<small>ORGANIZATION OF THE PILOUS SYSTEM.</small></h3>

<p>Whatever varieties exist in the form, size and arrangement
of the hairs, their organization is nearly the same in
all. We shall now examine this organization in a general
manner. Chirac, Malpighi and all anatomists since them,
have explained very well in some respects, and very badly
in others, the structure of the hairs of the head, which is
nearly the same as that of all the other hairs. The following
is what careful dissection has shown me concerning it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">392</span></p>


<h4>I. <i>Origin of the Hairs.</i></h4>

<p>The hairs of the head, and in general all the hairs, arise
from a sub-cutaneous fat, or the cellular texture of the
parts which are destitute of this fluid. Each is contained
at its origin, in a kind of small membranous canal, the
nature of which is perfectly unknown to me, and whose
transparent parietes allow the hair to be plainly seen,
when we have separated them with a delicate scalpel from
the surrounding parts. This small cylindrical canal accompanies
the hair to the corresponding pore of the skin,
insinuates itself into this pore, passes through it, extends
to the epidermis and is intermixed there with the texture
of this membrane, but goes no further. The length of
this canal, and consequently of the course which the hair
runs under and in the skin, is nearly five lines in the
hairs of the head. There is no adhesion between the hair
and the internal surface of this small canal, except at the
enlarged base of the first where, it receives its nourishment.
Thus, by opening the canal at this place, and
destroying its adhesions there, the hair becomes free, and
is drawn from without inwards with great ease, by taking
hold of its enlarged end with small forceps. In this way,
the canal is insulated. I have thus dissected and separated,
upon a surface of two inches, a very great number
of these canals which appear, when nothing but them is
left on the internal surface of the skin, like so many small
elongations of it.</p>

<p>Are there vessels and nerves in this small cylindrical
sac which contains the origin of the hairs? We see distinctly
elongations going to its external surface, especially
towards its extremity opposite to the skin; but dissection
does not teach us the nature of these elongations. I
have never been able to trace them to a neighbouring
vessel or nerve. Haller has not been more successful,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">393</span>
though he speaks of authors who have traced nerves to
the origin of the hairs. I presume however that these
elongations are especially vascular. Is there a fluid between
the origin of the hair and its covering? By opening
the latter, nothing escapes, though some authors have
pretended the contrary. Besides, if this fluid is in the
form of dew, as upon the serous surfaces, it cannot be
distinguished.</p>

<p>It is in the middle of this small cylindrical sac, of
which I have just spoken, that the origin of the hair is
found. We see at its extremity an enlargement oftentimes
almost insensible, at others very evident, though
always less than has been said. This enlargement is of
the same colour and nature as the hair itself. It adheres
to the canal very probably by the vessels and perhaps the
nerves it receives from it. The hair which arises from
it goes through its canal without adhering, as I have said,
to its parietes, passes with it through the oblique pore
of the dermis, leaves it at the epidermis, and goes outward.</p>

<p>All authors say that the hair does not pierce the epidermis,
but only raises it up, and that this forms a sheath
which accompanies it to its extremity. This assertion is
incorrect; in fact, 1st, the hair is as thick in its canal of
origin as it is out of it. 2d. This canal being opened at
its extremity opposite to the skin, we can draw out of it,
as I have said, the whole hair with great ease, and without
the least resistance; which would not be the case
however if the covering of the epidermis was to be
broken. It appears that from the enlargement of its extremity,
the hair has no adhesion either in the sub-cutaneous
canal, or in its passage through the skin, or the epidermis.
3d. If the cutaneous epidermis was raised up to
cover the hair, this would have a treble thickness, unless
this epidermis became wonderfully thin upon it. 4th.
We do not see this pretended rising up by drawing out a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">394</span>
hair of the head; on the contrary a depression exists at
the place where this comes out. The cutaneous epidermis
furnishes nothing then to the hairs, though the nature
of them may be in part the same as its own, and it is
proper to consider them as uniform in their structure from
one extremity to the other.</p>

<p>Under the skin, through it and out of it, the hair is
composed of two distinct parts. One external, forms a
canal which extends from the enlargement of the dermoid
extremity to the opposite one; the other internal, which
composes as it were the medulla of it, is of an unknown
nature.</p>


<h4>II. <i>External Covering of the Hairs.</i></h4>

<p>The external covering of the hair appears to be of the
nature of the epidermis. It has in fact almost all the
attributes of it. 1st. The hairs of the head burn exactly
like this membrane, give out when burning an analogous
odour, and leave after combustion a similar kind of coal;
now it is principally to the external portion that these
phenomena are owing. 2d. Water penetrates the hairs
with great ease; hence very useful hygrometers can be
constructed with them; now the same is true of the epidermis;
and moistened hairs in foggy weather present in
this respect a phenomenon analogous to that of the epidermis
softened, wrinkled and whitened by the contact of a
cataplasm. 3d. It is by means of the epidermoid covering
that the hairs are foreign to life, that they are insensible
and never become the seat of any acute or chronic
affection. 4th. This covering is white, whatever may be
the colour of the hairs. The cause of the colour resides
in the internal medulla; thus the epidermis of negroes
and that of white people differ but very little. Hence
why when the internal substance of the hair has disappeared,
the canal remaining alone exhibits a more or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">395</span>
less evident whiteness. 5th. In this state, though the interior
of the hair may be dead, the epidermoid exterior,
which is independent of it, preserves most commonly the
faculty of growing when it is cut; thus the cutaneous
epidermis is truly foreign to all the subjacent diseases of
the skin. 6th. I presume that it is this covering which
gives to the hairs of the head the property of remaining
so long uninjured. When removed far from the access of
the air, they remain unaltered for ages; they have not in
them the principle of decomposition of the other animal
substances. They never become putrid either in air or
water. Thus we have seen that the cutaneous epidermis
never undergoes putrefaction, which seizes upon the subjacent
parts.</p>

<p>It appears however that the hairs are more unalterable
than the epidermis, and that there is even a difference of
nature between them. In fact, 1st, maceration and ebullition,
which make the epidermis very easy to be broken,
though they soften it but little, leave the hairs with their
usual resistance, unless carried to degrees that I have not
tried. By boiling and macerating them comparatively
with the epidermis, we easily make this observation. 2d.
The acids act less efficaciously upon the hairs than upon
this membrane; but the alkalies dissolve them with as
much and even more ease. 3d. A thread of epidermis
of equal thickness would be incomparably less resisting
than a hair. 4th. The hairs can, like the epidermis, be
painted of different colours; but they do not retain them
so long, and on this account the colour must be renewed
oftener.</p>

<p>Some modern authors have said that there is detached
from the external covering of the hairs a kind of scales
which form as it were little branches to them. We do
not see these elongations. However the experiment mentioned
by Fourcroy, and which consists in this, that by
rubbing a hair between the fingers, it is raised like the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">396</span>
heads of some species of grain in the direction from its
base to its point, this experiment, I say, appears to prove
the existence of these insensible elongations, which perform
also an essential part in the adhesion of the hairs of
the head to each other, an adhesion that is such that when
they have remained a long time without being separated,
as in long diseases, it is only done with the greatest
difficulty.</p>

<p>Sometimes the hairs are bifurcated in a very evident
manner at their extremity.</p>

<p>It is the greater or less thickness of the epidermoid
covering of the hairs, which constitutes the different nature
of them. Thick and compact on the genital parts, the
chin, &amp;c. it is less easily penetrated with water, and renders
the hairs more elastic there and more capable of
curling. Loose and thin in the hairs of the head, it makes
them more smooth, and gives them more sensibly the property
of the hygrometer. It is the peculiar nature of this
external covering, which gives to the hairs of the head
and the hair of negroes the character which distinguishes
them.</p>

<p>From what we have just said it is evident that the external
covering of the hairs of the head is the part of them
which is essentially inert and foreign to life. It is not
the same with their internal substance.</p>


<h4>III. <i>Internal Substance of the Hairs.</i></h4>

<p>This substance is the most important; it is this which
essentially characterizes the hairs, which I should have
ranked in the epidermoid system, if they had nothing but
their external covering, as is the case when they become
white.</p>

<p>We are entirely ignorant of the nature of this internal
substance. It can only be presumed that there are extremely
delicate vessels inclosed in the common epider<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">397</span>moid
covering containing a colouring substance, which
stagnates in these vessels, or at least is subjected in them
to a very slow nutritive motion. Among these vessels,
do any of them as on the skin, open outwards to throw
off fluids? Many physiologists have thought so, and on
this account they have considered the hairs as real emunctories.
I do not believe that we have any anatomical
data upon this point; but the plica polonica, a singular
disease in which the hair when cut pours out blood, evidently
proves that they have exhalants in a natural state,
which then becoming enlarged and dilated, pour out a
fluid that they before refused to admit. Besides, there
is no doubt that the pilous exhalants, infinitely less active
than the cutaneous, are a much less copious emunctory.
As to the absorptions which some have pretended are
made by the vessels of the hairs, I think that nothing can
prove them.</p>

<p>From what we have just said upon the internal substance
of the hairs, it appears that it has a true analogy
with the reticular body of the skin, and that, like it, it
arises from two sorts of vessels, one in which the colouring
matter stagnates, the other which gives passage, in
some cases at least, to fluids, and in which there is consequently
a kind of circulation.</p>

<p>The colouring substance of the hairs has some analogy
with that of the skin. Thus we observe that the first,
like the second, is blacker in warm climates and nearer
the equator than in colder ones; thus red hair is frequently
found with freckles which are more or less abundantly
spread upon the skin of some people, and which
are evidently seated in the reticular body, as I have ascertained
in many patients who had these marks, and in
whom the epidermis was raised up either by erysipelas
or a blister. The acids however change the colour of the
hair more than they do that of the skin of negroes. The
muriatic whitens at first the hairs of the head which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">398</span>
become yellow in drying; the nitric yellows, and the
sulphuric leaves them black.</p>

<p>That which especially interests us in the internal substance
of the hairs, is the real vitality which it enjoys,
and which essentially distinguishes it from the external
covering. It is to this character that must be referred
the following phenomena.</p>

<p>1st. The different passions of the mind have a remarkable
influence upon the internal substance of the hairs.
Often, in a very short time, grief has changed the colour
of it, and whitened it by occasioning no doubt the reabsorption
of the fluid contained in the small capillary
vessels. Many authors have related facts of this kind.
Some, even Haller, have doubted them. But I know at
least five or six instances in which a discoloration has
taken place in less than eight days. The hair of a person
of my acquaintance became almost entirely white in the
course of a night upon the receipt of melancholy intelligence.
In these changes, the epidermoid covering remains
the same, preserves its texture, its nature and its
properties; the internal substance only is altered. It is
said that terror can make the hair stand an end; painters
express it even by this external attribute; I know not to
what extent we should give belief to this phenomenon
which I have never seen; but it is an opinion too generally
received not to have some real foundation. Now if
fear acts so powerfully upon the hair, if it can give it a
real motion, is it astonishing that grief and pain should
suddenly change the fluids that are found in it, and deprive
it even of these fluids?</p>

<p>2d. The plica polonica, of which I spoke just now, in
which the hairs of the head become, when they are cut or
even when they are not, the seat of a bloody exhalation,
and in which they have a remarkable excess of life, evidently
resides in the internal substance; the epidermoid
covering has no connexion with it. Some authors even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">399</span>
say that this internal substance acquires sometimes a fleshy
nature; then their covering is raised up in scales.</p>

<p>3d. We know the danger of cutting the hair after many
acute diseases. I have already seen a melancholy instance
of it. Many physicians, Lanoix in particular, have
related others. Now, to what are these accidents owing?
It is certainly not to the contact of the air, from which
the hair defends the head; for these accidents take place,
though the head may be covered. It can only be owing
to this, that the growth of the hairs that are cut, calls to
these organs a vital activity which the internal viscera
soon sympathetically feel; hence the pains of the head,
the affections of the eyes, &amp;c. observed in these cases.
It is a species of active sympathy exerted by the hair
upon the viscera; now, every organ which sympathizes
has a real vitality, and enjoys very distinct vital properties.
The epidermis never takes part in sympathies, because
it is almost completely inert, is hardly organized,
is not at the level of the other organs, and cannot consequently
correspond with them. The danger of cutting
the hair after severe sickness, gives me opportunity to
observe that it is often as dangerous to remove suddenly
the vermin from the heads of children during these diseases.
I have seen three or four instances of accidents
from this cause.</p>

<p>4th. The hairs not only influence other systems, but
are also influenced by them. This is what we often see
after acute diseases, in which the roots sympathetically
affected, repel the fluids that come to nourish them, die,
and the hairs fall out. Observe that this falling out of
the hair very rarely takes place at the same time with the
desquamation of the epidermis; which proves, that the
generally admitted opinion of the origin of the external
covering of the hairs is entirely false, and that, though
very analogous to the epidermis, this covering does not
arise from it, as I have said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">400</span></p>

<p>5th. Many animals lose at one season of the year their
hairy covering, which is afterwards reproduced; now the
period of its regeneration is often that of many diseases,
and almost always that of a greater weakness than at other
times. We might say that the nutritive work which then
calls to the exterior much vital force, diminishes this
force in the other regions. Man is not subject to these
annual renewals of the external productions which cover
his body, like birds, many quadrupeds, reptiles, &amp;c. It
is a cause of less diseases. In fact, a thousand different
causes would no doubt have frequently deranged these
renewals in society, as a thousand causes disturb the menstrual
evacuation, &amp;c.; hence the various diseases we
escape by the want of this renewal. Man is in general
subjected to fewer causes of natural revolutions, than most
animals.</p>

<p>6th. Heat and cold have also oftentimes an influence
upon the internal substance of the hairs. We know that
in some animals, as rabbits, hares, &amp;c. they become white
in the winter and resume their original colour in the summer.</p>

<p>7th. A short time after painting the hairs of the head
black, a fashion now more common in France than at the
period in which they powdered them, there is often experienced
pains in the head and a swelling of the hairy
scalp, though the skin has been in no way concerned,
has not been pulled, and the hair only has been affected.</p>

<p>It follows from all we have just said, that the hairs
analogous, by their external covering, to the epidermis;
foreign by means of it, if we may so say, to life, belong to
it much more particularly by their internal substance, a
substance whose nature is yet but little known, as I have
already said. What moreover evidently proves this assertion,
is that the phenomena of which I have just spoken,
and to which I could add many others, cease to be evident
in persons, in whom the hairs having become white,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">401</span>
have no longer any thing but the epidermoid covering,
the internal substance having in part disappeared; particular
observation proves this. It may be however that
in this case that portion alone of this internal substance,
corresponding to the colour, is destroyed, whilst that which
is the seat of the exhalations continues to live as usual;
and, in this respect, white hairs may experience vital
phenomena, of which, I believe, there are a few examples.
But all this is subordinate to the future experiments,
which will elucidate the pilous structure more than it
now is.</p>


<hr class="chap" />

<h3>ARTICLE THIRD.<br />

<small>PROPERTIES OF THE PILOUS SYSTEM.</small></h3>

<p>The hairs experience but a slight degree of the horny
hardening when exposed to the action of caloric. They
then turn in various directions, curl and twist; but this
arises from a cause entirely different from that of the
horny hardening of the other organs. The caloric then
removes the moisture with which the hairs are constantly
penetrated, and thus approximates their particles. Thus
when the hair is moistened by fog, a bath, &amp;c. the curls
disappear. The oily substances that are used at the toilet,
give a coat that is insoluble in water, and preserve the
curling, by preventing it from penetrating the hairs.
Some time after the head has been washed, they curl
more, as we have had occasion to observe since the Grecian
head dresses have been in fashion among us. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">402</span>
at first appears to be contradictory, but it is not so. In
fact by then rubbing the hairs much, the unctuous substance
is removed, which always surrounds them, or this
substance combines with the soap, if the water contains
it, as is often the case; by this means it easily penetrates
the hairs, the pores of which remain open, and by afterwards
evaporating with the fluids that were already there,
and which the unctuous substance retained, it leaves these
organs more dry than they were, and consequently more
disposed to curl.</p>

<p>A proof, that it is the epidermoid covering which thus
imbibes the moisture that it afterwards loses in the state
which succeeds the curling, is, that the detached epidermis
can be curled with a hot iron, and afterwards rendered
supple by soaking it in water.</p>

<p>The contractility and extensibility of texture are very
indistinct in the hairs; it is their resistance which prevents
their rupture; they can hardly be stretched at all.</p>

<p>They have no animal sensibility when pulled; the pain
that arises from it has its seat especially in the skin
through which they pass. Thus when drawn opposite to
their direction, we suffer much more than by stretching
them in the direction of their pores. I do not deny however
that these elongations, which fix their origin to the
neighbouring parts, may be also the seat of pain when
the hairs are pulled. These organs have no animal contractility.</p>

<p>The organic properties certainly exist in their internal
substance. The changes which this substance undergoes
can only depend on the different alterations which affect
these properties. The organic sensibility and the insensible
contractility especially are raised in it in a remarkable
degree in the plica polonica; now in order to have
the degree of energy which they then do, they must have
existed there in a natural state. It is these two properties,
that, the sympathies of which we have spoken,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">403</span>
put into action. The organic contractility is nothing in
the hairs.</p>

<p>Yet we cannot deny that in the natural state, these
organs are, next to the epidermis and the nails, those in
which life is the least active, those which have the least
numerous relations with the other organs. Whilst every
thing is destroyed in most of the other systems by diseases,
this is most often unaffected by them; it grows as
usual, and appears to be in no wise disturbed; it has then
a manner of being, of existing, wholly different from the
others.</p>

<p>In general, the external productions of animals, as the
feathers, the hair, the scales, &amp;c. seem to form a separate
class of organs, foreign to the life of the internal organs;
it is almost like the different species of mosses that grow
upon trees, without making essentially a part of them.</p>


<hr class="chap" />

<h3>ARTICLE FOURTH.<br />

<small>DEVELOPMENT OF THE PILOUS SYSTEM.</small></h3>


<h4>I. <i>State of this System in the First Age.</i></h4>

<p>In the first months of the fÅ“tus there are no hairs on
the skin which is then gelatinous. It is when the fibres
of the dermoid texture are formed, that there begins to
appear on the head a light down, an indication of the
hairs which are afterwards to arise. This down is whitish
and concealed by that fatty and unctuous substance, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">404</span>
we have said is deposited on the external surface of the
skin at this age. Soon this down, which appears to be
but the external covering of the hairs, which is then of
extreme tenuity, begins to be coloured black or flaxen,
according to the tint that is afterwards to predominate;
it is the internal substance that forms it. The colour remains
faint until after birth. At this period the hairs are
often more than half an inch long. Upon all the rest of
the body there is only the down, the precursor of the
hairs; the face especially has much of it. The hairs of
the head are then in advance at one period of the other
hairs, in their growth.</p>

<p>After birth the hairs grow much more rapidly than before.
It is precisely the reverse of most of the other
parts, whose growth is more rapid in the womb of the
mother. During the whole of youth this system has a
tint less deep, than it is afterwards to have. The flaxen
becomes nearer the chesnut, and this nearer black, and
the first tints of the bright red grow many degrees darker
towards the period from the twenty-sixth to the thirtieth
year. The light tints are to the pilous system in youth,
what the imperfectly developed forms are to the muscular,
cellular, &amp;c. Oftentimes that which is to be afterwards
flaxen, approaches a whitish tint, which is owing
only to the nature of the internal substance, and not to its
absence in old age. Thus the white of the Albinos depends
also upon the peculiar species of this internal substance.
Many hairs are wanting upon the body of the
young man.</p>


<h4>II. <i>State of the Pilous System in the following Ages.</i></h4>

<p>At puberty there is a remarkable revolution in this
system which becomes almost double. The hairs of the
genital parts are formed; the beard which is, as I have
said, the characteristic attribute of the male in the human
species, is also then developed. We might say that there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">405</span>
was the same relation between the hairs of the neighbourhood
of the testicles and those of the beard, as between
the testicles themselves and the organs of the
voice, between the womb and the mammÃ¦. The beard
is, in this respect, the external sign of virility. Some
time before it comes out, we see under the skin the sac
which contains the origin of the hairs; it is already very
evidently formed, and permits the principle of the organ
to be seen which it is to contain, as I have oftentimes ascertained;
thus the sac of the tooth exists a long time before
the tooth is cut.</p>

<p>At the same time the hairs of the axilla grow also;
those of the trunk and extremities, which were then almost
in a state of down, become larger, assume a determinate
colour, and increase even much in number.</p>

<p>Why does puberty occasion this general growth in the
pilous system? This is asking the reason of all the other
phenomena which appear at this period. I would only
observe that the hairs of the head, the eyebrows, the eyelashes
and the hairs at the openings of the body, are those
which are the least affected by this revolution. Besides,
this growth is gradual; it requires at least two or three
years for the beard to become what it is always to be.</p>

<p>In the following ages the hairs undergo but few changes;
they grow in proportion as they are cut in different parts,
and are the seat of a constant external work; now, observe
that this work is more prompt, and the growth of the
hairs consequently more rapid, in summer in which the
cutaneous organ is especially in action, than in winter in
which it is contracted; an additional proof of the real
vitality of the organic forces of the internal substance of
the hairs.</p>


<h4>III. <i>State of the Pilous System in Old Age.</i></h4>

<p>Towards the end of life, the pilous system is affected
by the general obliteration which takes place in almost all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">406</span>
the external vessels; it ceases at first to receive the colouring
substance. The internal substance dies, the epidermoid
covering remains alone; the hairs become white.
The hairs of the head appear the first, and are the first to
die. The beard, the hairs of the genital parts and then
those of all the parts of the body afterwards die. Besides,
there is a great variety among men as it respects
the period in which the hairs whiten; in some, this phenomenon
begins about the thirtieth year, and even sooner,
in others it is towards the fortieth, fiftieth or sixtieth. A
thousand causes arising from the passions of the mind,
from diseases, aliments, &amp;c. can have an influence in society
upon this premature death, so common in many
men, but which does not take place in animals, who are
not exposed from their kind of life, to the same revolutions,
until the last years.</p>

<p>The hairs, after remaining white for a longer or shorter
time, finally fall out; then the sac which covered the
origin of them flattens down and entirely disappears. I
have examined many bald heads; the skin of the cranium
was perfectly smooth on its internal surface, though it
had been separated from the cellular texture. No trace
is discoverable there of the innumerable appendices which
the canals form, after the hairs they contain have been
drawn inwards. I have also dissected a man who after a
putrid fever had become almost entirely bald. There
were all these little canals entire, and in the bottom of
them could already be seen the rudiments of new hairs.
There is then this difference between the falling out of
the hairs of old people, and that which is the consequence
of diseases, that every thing dies in the first, because the
vessels which go to the root cease to transmit fluids to it;
whereas in the second case the hair alone falls out, and
its sac remains.</p>

<p>It is a pretty generally received opinion that the hair,
the nails and the epidermis continue to grow after death.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">407</span>
We have, I think, but few data respecting this singular
phenomenon. I am however certain that I observed a
real elongation of the hairs of a chin of a head that had
been carefully shaved, and which I macerated eight days
in a cellar. An attendant of the dissecting room, who
prepares many heads for the bones, informed me that he
had often made the same remark, when putrefaction is
prevented for some time. What is certain also is, that the
growth of the beard is not in the direct ratio of the vital
forces; in the diseases which affect these forces with
a general prostration, it grows as much as in those in
which there is a general exaltation of these forces. We
remark this in hospitals where at the side of an inflammatory
fever, there is often found a putrid or slow nervous
one. Besides, why should there not be sufficient
tonic forces left in the hairs to grow some time after
general death, as there is in the lymphatics to absorb, &amp;c.?</p>

<p>The different phenomena which the hair, the epidermis,
the skin, and in general all the external organs experience
in the successive ages, are wholly owing, like
those of the internal organs, to the laws of nutrition, and
not to the action of surrounding bodies. This is an essential
difference between organic and inorganic bodies. The
latter are gradually altered in two ways by the contact of
external bodies which act upon them, 1st, mechanically
by friction, tearing, &amp;c. &amp;c.; 2d, chemically, by combining
with them, as for example, the air whose different
principles undergo many combinations which change its
nature and that of the bodies with which it is in contact.
In this respect all inorganic bodies grow old. At the end
of some time, they have no longer the exterior which
characterized them in the beginning. Observe monuments,
pictures, engravings, earths, metals, stones, &amp;c. &amp;c. every
thing which in the arts, commerce, sciences, in the uses of
life or in the phenomena of nature is formed of any inert
bodies, whether these bodies have never lived, or having<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">408</span>
lived, have not been able to preserve themselves after death,
as the solid portions of vegetables, the bones, the horns, the
hair of animals, &amp;c. every thing finally has the indelible
stamp of time; every thing grows old; every thing loses
its freshness, every thing changes on the exterior of inert,
as well as on that of organic bodies; but as in the first surrounding
bodies alone have acted, the internal part is still
young, whilst the external is old, if I may be allowed to
use two very improper words. Thus the rock whose surface
is blackened by the lapse of years, is the same in the
interior as when it was created. On the contrary in animals
and vegetables, the internal organs are worn out, as
well as the exterior. Time is marked upon the viscera, as
well as upon the forehead of the aged. Surrounding
bodies act upon us, wear out life, if we may so say; but
it is as stimuli that they exert their action; it is by exhausting
the sensibility and contractility, and not by combination,
mechanical contact or friction. Language ought
to express this difference. We do not use the term
<i>young</i> when viewing the exterior of a new building, a
new garment, or a picture recently painted; why do we
say an <i>old</i> monument, an <i>old</i> piece of cloth, &amp;c.? if it is
a metaphor, very well; but this word cannot express a
state analogous in its nature, to that of an old animal, an
old plant, &amp;c.</p>


<h4>IV. <i>Preternatural Development.</i></h4>

<p>There are three principal cases in which the hairs are
preternaturally developed in the economy.</p>

<p>1st. Sometimes they are formed on the internal surface
of the mucous membranes; they have been seen in
the bladder, the stomach and the intestines; many authors
have given cases of them. I have found them upon the
calculi of the kidney. I have seen in the gall-bladder at
one time a dozen of nearly an inch in length, and which
were evidently implanted in its surface.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">409</span></p>

<p>2d. There is often seen on the skin preternatural collections
of them, which are usually a defect from birth.
These collections are particularly observed upon some of
those productions or irregular excrescences, that are called
nÃ¦vi materni. There was exhibited at Paris, six years
since, an unfortunate person, who had from his birth his
face covered with hairs almost like those of a wild boar;
and to whom there came on at the age of thirty-six years,
that particular species of elephantiasis, in which the skin of
the face increased in size, exhibits, if we may so say, the
features of the lion, a species which I have since had
occasion to observe upon a natural skin. This double
circumstance gave to the face of this man an air of ferocity
which it is impossible to describe. Many of the
stories circulated by the vulgar concerning men with the
heads of wild boars, bears, &amp;c. are nothing but these nÃ¦vi
in the face, with a growth of hair upon them.</p>

<p>3d. Hairs are often preternaturally developed in cysts,
in those of the ovaria especially. A great many instances
have been related. Haller in particular has collected
many; I have seen two. The following is what they exhibit;
a considerable large sac contained many very distinct
small balls, analogous to those of the dung of sheep,
formed by a fat, unctuous, whitish substance, very different
in its appearance from ordinary fat. On the internal
surface of this sac were implanted many hairs, which the
least force could remove, because they hardly penetrated
below the surface. These hairs were black. Many
already detached were found crossed in different directions,
in the small balls of fatty matter, which was like
spermaceti; for it very much resembled the substance
into which the fat is changed by maceration.</p>

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
